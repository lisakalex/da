<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Bitget went forward with key investments amid the digital asset winter setting the tone for favourable market conditions in the future.¬†</p>
<p>In a Jan 4 <a href="https://x.com/wublockchain/status/1742854762960421022?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">interview with Colin Wu</a>, the Bitget executive explained the role the exchange took in the bear market, its expansion strategy, achievements, coin listings, and a pathway towards 2024.¬†</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gracy Chen Explains Bitget: Why Adopt Aggressive Strategies in a Bear Market? The Direction for 2024? What is the Rumored &quot;Wolf Culture&quot;?<a href="https://t.co/KWkF804BLy">https://t.co/KWkF804BLy</a> <a href="https://t.co/cKtijZjW28">pic.twitter.com/cKtijZjW28</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1742854762960421022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Chen explained that the company kicked off operations five years ago but began gaining rapid traction in the last two years witnessing both bear and bull markets.¬†</p>
<p>The previous <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chainalysis-lays-off-another-150-employees-amid-ongoing-market-downturn.htm">bear market</a> preceding 2020 taught the firm a lot that saw it handle the 2022 season better making strategic partnerships striving towards international expansion in a competitive market.¬†</p>
<p>According to the executive, those who believe in the growth of the sector make investments during the bear market. The firm acquired assets at low prices, onboarded staff while competitors saw walkouts, and most importantly, invested in web3 projects to shape the industry and increase decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-news/">DeFi</a>) numbers.¬†</p>
<p><i>‚Äú</i><i>Assets are cheaper, and the talents who truly stay in the industry are the real believers. Therefore, it‚Äôs more appropriate to lay out during a bear market. We‚Äôve been through cycles of bull and bear alternation, so we have a deeper understanding and thorough knowledge of these situations.‚Äù</i></p>
<p>Chen also disclosed the company‚Äôs coin listing strategy as a blend of speed and quality to improve user experience. An example was the ARB token and other projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem including GMX as the exchange responds to market hotspots.¬†</p>
<p>The firm seeks the perfect balance for market trends and user experience creating a fast and responsible platform.¬†</p>
<h2>Regulatory framework toward 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitgets-gracy-chen-on-2024-crypto-market-trends-and-potential-supercycle.htm">recent interview with Cryptonews</a>, Chen highlighted market milestones, regulatory developments, and global expansion strategies in the wake of institutional inflows in the market.¬†</p>
<p>She hailed the recent regulatory milestone hit by countries in the Middle East and North African region as well as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-to-become-the-next-crypto-etf-hub-as-btc-etf-anticipation-continues-in-us.htm">Hong Kong</a> with regulators opening up new hubs and issuing licenses to firms within local frameworks.¬†</p>
<p>However, the United States remains an uncertain space in terms of regulation although investors have high hopes for space.¬†</p>
<p>Still, on regulations, Chen views the latest settlement with Binance and the Department of Justice (DOJ) as taking the issue of compliance to the next level. The firm strategy amidst this is to obtain licenses in many countries acquire regional exchanges with the regulatory nod and incorporate them into their operations.¬†</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="üí∞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The DoJ is seeking a settlement of more than $4 billion from <a href="https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@binance</a> as a proposed resolution to a yearlong investigation into the exchange, Bloomberg reported on Monday citing people familiar with discussions.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoNews</a><a href="https://t.co/JnS69Kf5YV">https://t.co/JnS69Kf5YV</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptonews/status/1726707662186811804?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The company does not currently participate in the United States market citing unclear regulations. For 2024, the firm will adopt strategies that involve listing more coins, fostering partnerships, and gaining licenses.¬†</p>
<p>‚Äú<i>We believe running a centralized exchange is not a sprint but a marathon. It‚Äôs a contest of endurance and strategy, with the key being who can continue moving forward, not who runs the fastest.‚Äù</i></p>

<h2>CEO of Collapsed Crypto Fund HyperVerse Seems to Not Exist At All</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The man introduced as the chief executive officer of <strong>HyperVerse</strong>, Steven Reece Lewis, appears not to exist ‚Äì at least not as the man with a long and impressive list of credentials the company cited. No organization on that list could find any record of him, the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/04/chief-executive-of-collapsed-crypto-fund-hyperverse-does-not-appear-to-exist">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Last month‚Äôs Guardian Australia investigation found that thousands of people lost millions of dollars to the <strong>HyperVerse</strong> crypto scheme, linked to a previous scheme called <strong>HyperFund</strong>, under the umbrella organization the <strong>HyperTech</strong> group.</p>
<p>The Australian entrepreneur Sam Lee and his business partner Ryan Xu promoted the company. The duo were the founders of the collapsed Australian bitcoin company <strong>Blockchain Global</strong>.</p>
<p>Per the Guardian, Lee has denied both HyperVerse was a scam and being its founder. Xu could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a man named Steven Reece Lewis was introduced as the HyperVerse CEO at an online global launch event in December 2021. The introduction featured video messages of support from celebrities, including the <strong>Apple</strong> co-founder Steve Wozniak and actor Chuck Norris.</p>
<p>Promotional materials and career summaries said Reece Lewis was a graduate of the <strong>University of Leeds</strong> and held a master‚Äôs degree from the <strong>University of Cambridge</strong>, that he had worked for <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, sold a web development company to <strong>Adobe</strong>, and launched an IT start-up firm.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúReece Lewis‚Äôs identity could not be verified by the Guardian, nor could he be contacted for comment.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Guardian Australia contacted all the above-cited institutions and has confirmed that none has any record of someone by that name on their databases.</p>
<p>Reece Lewis also had no internet presence other than HyperVerse promotional material. A <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenr_lewis?lang=en">Twitter account</a> was set up a month before his December 2021 introduction. It was active only until June 2022.</p>
<h2>Klaytn Launches the First Gold RWA DeFi Platform Outside Ethereum</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <strong>Klaytn Foundation</strong>, established to build and decentralize the ecosystem of Layer 1 blockchain <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-21-radix-klaytn-apecoin.htm">Klaytn</a></strong>, announced that the <strong>Klaytn Governance Council</strong> (GC) member CREDER has launched <strong>GPC</strong> (Gold-Pegged Coin), a digital asset pegged to the real-time market price of gold, and <strong>Goldstation</strong>, a decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/varas-new-leadership-in-dubai-marks-next-phase-of-crypto-regulation.htm">DeFi</a>) platform for GPC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/klaytn-onboards-goldstation-and-gpc-launching-the-first-gold-rwa-defi-platform-outside-of-ethereum-302024388.html">Per</a> the press release, GPC marks two firsts in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization industry. It is the first tokenized gold available on DeFi outside the <strong>Ethereum</strong> ecosystem and the first gold-pegged token that does not charge a percentage-based commission for transactions.</p>
<p>Goldstation is also the first gold RWA token DeFi platform powered by a public mainnet other than Ethereum.</p>
<p>It will commence its services on January 24. While currently only available for South Korean residents, Goldstation plans a global launch in the future.</p>
<h2>Wirex Reveals Strategy to Tackle Dark Web and Mule Account Risks</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Crypto payments platform <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/wirex-unveils-zero-knowledge-proof-based-non-custodial-crypto-debit-card-service.htm">Wirex</a></strong> announced an enhancement in its measures to combat Dark Web activities and money mule threats.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/wirex-launches-innovative-strategy-to-tackle-dark-web-and-mule-account-risks-302024835.html">According</a> to the press release, the company has incorporated US-based cybersecurity company <strong>ZeroFox&#8217;s</strong> Dark Web Monitoring tool into its system, creating a unified solution.</p>
<p>This way, a combination of human and artificial intelligence (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/square-enix-in-2024-doubling-down-on-blockchain-ai-and-metaverse-technologies.htm">AI</a>) actively scans the Dark Web for potential dangers in real time. This includes leaked data, compromised credentials, and other sensitive information.</p>
<p>This is a proactive approach that allows for early detection and prompt intervention.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWirex benefits from ZeroFox&#8217;s advanced monitoring capabilities, utilising a sophisticated system that issues detailed alerts about potential threats, including their severity and escalation status, ensuring a quick and effective response to incidents,‚Äù the company said.</p>
<h2>KuCoin Labs Announces Its Strategic Investment in ISSP</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kucoin-labs-invests-in-btc-layer-2-dovi-to-advance-bitcoin-ecosystem-development.htm">KuCoin Labs</a></strong>, the investment and incubation arm of the crypto exchange <strong>KuCoin</strong>, has announced its investment in <strong>ISSP</strong>. The latter is the first cross-chain inscription protocol system on the <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-january-2-mina-protocol-sei-sui.htm">Sui</a></strong> network known for its high throughput and scalability.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240102622781/en/KuCoin-Labs-Announces-Its-Strategic-Investment-in-ISSP-the-First-Cross-chain-Inscription-Protocol-on-Sui-to-Advance-Users%E2%80%99-Inscription-Experience">According</a> to the press release, this investment is aimed at supporting the development of ISSP‚Äôs inscription protocol.</p>
<p>More than a financial venture, it added, the investment is a strategic step towards fostering innovative solutions in the blockchain sector.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe focus on ISSP‚Äôs inscription protocol marks a new era in blockchain technology, paving the way for more secure, efficient, and scalable blockchain applications. Both KuCoin Labs and ISSP are dedicated to pushing the envelope in blockchain technology, aiming to make a significant impact in the industry,‚Äù the teams added.</p>

<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has unveiled progress in the development of the digital euro, with the publication of a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/news/html/ecb.mipnews240103_2.en.html">report</a> detailing the advancements made by the digital euro scheme&#8217;s Rulebook Development Group (RDG).</p>
<p>The update follows a June 2023 report from the same group, and highlights the completion of the initial chapters of the digital euro rulebook, aligning with legislative proposals and design decisions greenlit by the ECB&#8217;s Governing Council.</p>
<p>The first draft of the rulebook serves as an intermediate version, encompassing functional and operational models, technical scheme requirements, and the adherence model, which outlines the rights and obligations of scheme members based on the draft legislation.</p>
<p>According to the report, the first complete rulebook draft with all chapters included will be prepared during the ongoing digital euro ‚Äúpreparation phase.‚Äù</p>
<p>RDG members, representing consumers, retailers, and intermediaries, collaborated over the past months to develop these chapters, emphasizing inclusivity and diverse perspectives, the ECB said.</p>
<h2>Opportunity for stakeholders to give feedback</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The rulebook draft is currently undergoing an interim review, providing stakeholders with the opportunity to scrutinize and offer feedback on its current state.</p>
<p>The RDG will consider making adjustments based on received feedback, with a goal of ensuring a comprehensive and adaptable regulatory framework.</p>
<p>According to the ECB, flexibility is a key feature of the draft rulebook, ensuring it is capable of accommodating future adjustments aligned with the digital euro legislative process.</p>
<p>In the preparation phase, the RDG will intensify efforts to finalize the rulebook, introducing additional sections on user experience requirements, branding and communication standards, certification processes, testing and approval procedures, internal rules, risk management, and interoperability and implementation specifications, the ECB statement said.</p>
<h2>Still no formal decision on euro CBDC</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The ECB has not yet made a final decision on whether or not a digital euro will be launched, but ECB President Christine Lagarde is known as a strong proponent of a European central bank digital currency (CBDC), as well as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/european-central-bank-president-christine-lagarde-calls-for-crypto-regulation-eu-following-ftx-collapse-says-it-very-much-needed.htm">critic of private cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>
<p>Among other things, the ECB President has claimed that her <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ecb-president-christine-lagarde-says-her-son-lost-almost-all-money-he-invested-in-crypto.htm">son lost ‚Äúalmost all‚Äù the money he invested in crypto</a>.</p>
<p>In September last year, Lagarde¬†<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ecb-chief-lagarde-says-digital-euro-not-yet-out-there-would-take-two-years.htm">said that a digital Euro pilot</a>¬†‚Äúwill probably take us another two years, at least, before it‚Äôs the final say.‚Äù</p>
<p>At the time, she also said that a euro CBDC will not eradicate cash, nor substitute it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf it can be user friendly, if it can be free, if it can be a universal digital mode of payment throughout the entire Euro system, I think it will have checked many of the boxes, which I believe would characterize it as success,‚Äù she noted.</p>

<p>The Ethereum-based asset management protocol, Gamma Strategies, is currently investigating an ongoing security incident that may have resulted in the depletion of at least 211.9 Ether (ETH).</p>

<p>&mdash; Gamma (@GammaStrategies) <a href="https://twitter.com/GammaStrategies/status/1742772630699364759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On January 4, the blockchain investigator <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1742753372334399513">PeckShield</a> detected an exploit linked to Gamma Strategies with an estimated value of approximately $469,000.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the DeFi platform confirmed a &#8220;possible security incident&#8221; but reassured users that fund withdrawals remained possible. The protocol is investigating the incident, and it has promised to provide further details once the investigation is complete.</p>
<p>In response to the ongoing incident, Gamma Strategies has taken immediate action to prevent further losses. The team has disabled deposits in all public DeFi vaults while ensuring that withdrawals remain active for users who need to access their funds.</p>
<p>Despite the incident, the protocol&#8217;s vaults will continue to be managed normally for the time being. However, deposits have been temporarily shut down until the team identifies and mitigates the problem.</p>
<p>However, analysts from the security firm BlockSec <a href="https://x.com/Phalcon_xyz/status/1742781426926227463?s=20">reported</a> a critical vulnerability in the protocol&#8217;s accounting mechanism, specifically citing an inconsistency between the accounting mechanisms used by Gamma Strategies for depositing and withdrawing.</p>
<p>This inconsistency results in a discrepancy between liquidity and shares, allowing the attacker to withdraw an excessive amount of tokens.</p>
<p>Additionally, during the confusion surrounding the security incident, a fake verified Twitter account impersonating Gamma&#8217;s social media presence was discovered. This fake account attempted to redirect actual investors to a phishing website, urging users to &#8220;revoke all approvals to prevent loss of funds.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fake post garnered more likes and views than the original Gamma tweet warning about the security incident. Investors are advised to exercise caution, double-check all links, and only interact with Gamma through official channels until investigations conclude.</p>
<h2><b>Gamma Strategies Investigates Breach as Cryptocurrency Sector Continues to Grapple with Hacks and Losses in 2023</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The latest breach adds to the series of hacks that have plagued the cryptocurrency sector. In 2023, the industry suffered almost <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hacking-incidents-decreased-for-first-time-since-2021-still-2-billion-in-crypto-assets-stolen-in-2023.htm">$2 billion in losses</a> due to such incidents, with the largest hacks occurring in the year&#8217;s second half.</p>
<p>The Mixin platform experienced a significant blow in September, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-mixin-networks-cloud-service-provider-hacked-200-million-funds-affected.htm">losing $200 million</a>, and was unable to locate the attacker or retrieve the funds. However, Mixin committed to compensating users for half of their lost holdings.</p>
<p>Other notable breaches included a security incident at the popular crypto exchange Poloniex in November, initially reported at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-security-firm-peckshield-reports-suspicious-activity-in-poloniex-exchange-wallet-60-million-drained.htm">$33 million and later adjusted to over $120 million</a>. The crypto gambling platform Stake also faced a $41 million theft in September.</p>
<p>However, KyberSwap, another crypto firm, reported a revenue loss of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-hacked-for-48-million-hackers-suggest-negotiations.htm">$49 million</a> resulting from an exploit and, as a result, is planning to downsize its team by half to sustain the company&#8217;s day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>As part of the efforts to mitigate the financial impact of the exploit, Kyber Network&#8217;s CEO, Victor Tran, announced a temporary pause on the liquidity protocol initiatives and the KyberAI project. While these initiatives have been temporarily suspended, the core business functions of KyberSwap, such as its Aggregator and Limit Order features, remain operational.</p>

<p>The investment arm and incubator of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Binance Labs, has invested in the Memecoin (MEME) token.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-in-meme-the-native-token-of-memeland-from-the-creators-of-9gag-1370020903256087146">According to an announcement on January 4</a>, Binance Labs revealed that it has invested in the naive ecosystem token of Memeland, a project focused on creating and investing in the social economy. However, the size of the investment has yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>Prior to Binance Labs&#8217; investment in MEME, the cryptocurrency was featured as Binance Launchpool&#8217;s 39th project in October 2023. Binance Launchpool is a platform that allows users to stake their Binance Coin (BNB), TUSD, and FDUSD in distinct pools for a 30-day farming adventure, earning MEME tokens as rewards.</p>
<p>On October 28, 2023, Binance officially <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/9gag-meme-memeland-is-memekombat-next.htm">announced</a> this initiative, providing crypto enthusiasts with the opportunity to participate in the Launchpool and earn MEME token rewards. Users could stake their assets in specific pools, and in return, they would receive MEME tokens. A significant pool of 1,380,000,000 MEME tokens, equivalent to 2% of the total token supply, was allocated as rewards for participants in this campaign.</p>
<p>Announced in April 2022, Memeland operates as an independent Web3 venture studio under 9GAG, a well-known meme platform with a monthly audience of 200 million users worldwide. The Memeland team has over fifteen years of experience in creating community-based products and is dedicated to the mission of bringing ownership to communities worldwide.</p>
<p>In addition to NFTs and the MEME token, Memeland offers features such as MEME Farming and plans to introduce upcoming services to enhance user experiences and community involvement. These include unique NFT staking mechanisms, collaborative social networks for community members, and liquid staking of ETH.</p>
<p>The long-term vision is for Memeland to become a fully decentralized, community-driven platform, allowing current NFT holders to participate in governing the Memeland DAO.</p>
<h2><b>Crypto Token MEME Surges 8% After Binance Labs Investment Announcement</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
After Binance Labs&#8217; investment announcement was made, the MEME crypto price shot up by over 8% amid recent declines. However, the gain was short-lived, as the crypto saw a pullback within a few minutes. At press time, the MEME crypto price dropped by 2.67% to $0.02739 on Thursday, January 4, 2023.</p>
<p>Despite the slump, a significant recovery was recorded since the digital asset had earlier witnessed a plunge of over 12% in today&#8217;s trading session. Earlier in the past week, the Memecoin price lost over 5% in value. Furthermore, it plunged by 15% in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>In addition, the crypto&#8217;s market cap dipped by 2.70% to $243.16 million. On the contrary, MEME crypto witnessed a spike in demand. Its 24-hour trade volume skyrocketed by a whopping 352.19% and was recorded to be $268.29 million.</p>
<p>Memeland had previously announced $10 million in commitments for the token sale and is planning airdrops and a firesale for MEME to boost investor interest amidst the coin&#8217;s volatility. The token is predicted to reach $0.1 from a firesale price of $0.001.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.memeland.com/">public details</a>, some upcoming Memeland platforms are travel service <a href="http://holders.com/">Holders.com</a>, video sharing service <a href="http://gmgm.com/">GMGM.com</a>, crypto staking application Stakeland, and Petsland, a pets-focused service.</p>

<p>Blockchain analysts from <strong>Match Systems</strong> have found that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/orbit-chain-hacker-swaps-stolen-usdt-for-eth-rakes-in-1-45-million-profits.htm"><strong>Orbit Chain</strong></a> hackers used the same tactics as those in several other high-profile attacks &#8211; suggesting that a cybercrime organization, possibly the infamous <strong>Lazarus Group</strong>, stands behind these hacks.</p>
<p>This criminal group seems to have been busy last year. Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/orbit-hacker-may-have-also-performed-coinspaid-coinex-hacks-onchain-experts">cited</a> a January 3, 2024, report by Match Systems, naming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/north-koreas-lazarus-group-suspected-37-million-hack-coinspaid.htm"><strong>Coinspaid</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinex-crypto-exchange-hit-by-28-million-exploit-four-hot-wallets-drained.htm"><strong>Coinex</strong></a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/atomic-wallet-hackers-hide-35-million-stolen-crypto-funds-using-thorchain-heres-what-you-need-know.htm"><strong>Atomic Wallet</strong></a> among the group&#8217;s victims.</p>
<p>Per the report,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[The analysis] gives reason to believe that the same criminal group may be involved in the hacking of the Orbit bridge, which in 2023 had previously committed several large hacks of the cryptocurrency services Atomic wallet, CoinsPaid, CoinEx, etc., using tools and patterns of the well-known Lazarus group.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As the new year approached, hackers <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/orbit-suspends-cross-chain-bridge-contract-after-82m-exploit.htm">exploited</a> <strong>Orbit Bridge</strong>, the cross-chain bridging service of a South Korean-based multi-asset Orbit Chain, making off with $82 million.</p>

<h2>Common Threads</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The analysts found that the hackers used <strong>Tornado Cash</strong>. They had gas funds from other accounts that <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5e35f4b1886d62543cc027b5c0ef54aac3901a25c37d8ea6b1ab8861c9bd09dd">withdrew them</a> from the popular crypto mixer.</p>
<p>A mixer does &#8216;mixes&#8217; different funds in order to obscure the trail leading back to the original sources. Therefore, hackers use it to mix their identifiable funds with others&#8217; funds.</p>
<p>That said, Match System reportedly &#8216;de-mixed&#8217; the funds using specialized software. It analyzed the &#8220;characteristics and patterns before and after the Tornado.cash mixer, considering transaction volumes and dates/times, as well as other specialized methods.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the team discovered was a group of addresses. One of them used the <strong>SWFT</strong> protocol to transfer funds to other addresses. The protocol was also used in the <strong>DFX Finance</strong>, <strong>Deribit</strong>, and <strong>AscendEX</strong> attacks.</p>
<p>Following the Oribit attack, a portion of the funds sent through SWFT traveled through a number of chains, gathering in a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cybersecurity-firm-dwallet-labs-discovers-fixes-500-million-vulnerability-tron-network.htm"><strong>Tron</strong></a> wallet. It was then transferred to an exchange and cashed out.</p>
<p>Another common factor, the analysts argue, is that the attackers used <strong>Avalanche Bridge</strong> and <strong>Sinbad</strong> in the Orbit attack and several earlier attacks.</p>
<p>Per the team,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[These are] tools and patterns of the well-known Lazarus group.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin protocol developer <strong>Casey Rodarmor</strong> has strongly reiterated his opposition to censoring transactions on the blockchain, including controversial media inscriptions enabled by his own <strong>Ordinals project</strong>.</p>
<p>In a biting new blog post, Rodarmor excoriated ideological maximalists within the <strong>Bitcoin community</strong> as hypocrites for supporting censorship while simultaneously professing Bitcoin as &#8220;unstoppable&#8221; money immune from meddling.</p>

<h2>Rodarmor Defends Bitcoin Ordinals Against Censorship Calls</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://rodarmor.com/blog/inscriptions-a-guide-for-the-ideological-maxi/">Rodarmor argued that attempts to censor <strong>Bitcoin ordinals</strong> could open the door to broader censorship efforts</a>, contending nothing can feasibly stop people from leveraging Bitcoin&#8217;s transparency.</p>
<p>He believes maximalists uncomfortably reject reality when attacking functionality beyond payments, he wrote.</p>
<p>Rodarmor contends the reality is that nothing can feasibly stop people from leveraging the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">blockchain&#8217;s transparency</a> for purposes maximalists deem frivolous or illegitimate, like inscribing arbitrary images and messages.</p>
<p>According to the post, he believes the maximalist desire to restrict Bitcoin&#8217;s use stems from an &#8220;uncomfortable contact with a reality&#8221; that fails to match their ideological vision. This causes them to reactively attack anything that expands functionality beyond payments.</p>
<p>While indifferent about defending inscriptions themselves, Rodarmor categorically rejects technocratic tinkering to block any valid transactions, no matter how objectionable. For him, maintaining <strong>&#8220;uncensorable&#8221;</strong> as a <strong>core attribute</strong> of <strong>Bitcoin</strong> overrides other considerations.</p>
<h2><strong>Embracing Bitcoin Ordinals&#8217; Market Potential</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Instead, Rodarmor proposes allowing <strong>free market dynamics</strong> to naturally determine the value of inscriptions and other applications competing for limited block space.</p>
<p>He claims the inevitable solution is <strong>high on-chain fees</strong> pricing out lower-value uses like trivial media.&#8221;Bitcoin&#8217;s destiny is high fees. Embrace it,&#8221; Rodarmor wrote.</p>
<p>He advised maximalists to &#8220;stop being losers&#8221; by redirecting efforts toward expanding <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s reach</strong> and <strong>real-world usage</strong> rather than hampering new functionalities.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Rodarmor believes the path to cryptocurrency&#8217;s mass acceptance requires embracing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/decoding-web3-blockchain-laboratories-set-to-revolutionize-esg-markets-with-innovative-solutions.htm">outside-the-box enhancements on top of Bitcoin</a> and letting its full, dynamic potential unfold. Restricting possibilities risks turning an open platform into a <strong>narrow orthodoxy</strong>.</p>
<p>At its core, Rodarmor makes a compelling case for letting the free market run its course. If Bitcoin is to fulfill its destiny as an open, decentralized ledger, the community must resist the urge to over-engineer every perceived problem.</p>
<p>With a spirit of openness and a balance of pragmatism, Bitcoin can move beyond a radical idea into a global force for <strong>economic freedom</strong>.</p>

<p>South Korea&#8217;s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has <a href="https://www.fsc.go.kr/po040301/view?noticeId=3954&amp;curPage=&amp;srchKey=&amp;srchText=&amp;srchBeginDt=&amp;srchEndDt=">announced a proposal</a> to amend its Enforcement Decree of the Credit-Specialized Financial Business Act, aiming to ban <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-today-january-3-conflux-sei-internet-computer.htm">crypto</a> purchases with credit cards.</p>
<p>The proposed amendment plans to restrict the use of credit cards for purchasing cryptocurrencies on foreign exchanges. According to the FSC, it is driven by concerns over illegal outflows of domestic funds, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/european-banking-authority-calls-for-enhanced-anti-money-laundering-rules-for-crypto-providers-regulation-incoming.htm">money laundering</a>, and the fostering of speculative behavior in cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<h2>Korea FSC Highlights Risks in Overseas Crypto Trading</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Included in the Content section, the FSC addressed, ‚ÄúConcerns have been raised about illegal outflow of domestic funds overseas due to card payments on overseas virtual asset exchanges, money laundering, speculation, and encouragement of speculative activities.‚Äù</p>
<p>In addition, the FSC expected that ‚Äúa basis for cooperation with international brands will be established and prevention of foreign currency outflow and money laundering will be strengthened.‚Äù</p>
<p>The proposal listed a public feedback period extending until Feb. 13, allowing for input and comments from individuals and organizations. Following this period, the amendment is expected to undergo review and be voted on, with the goal of implementing the new rules in the first half of 2024.</p>
<h2>South Korean Officials&#8217; Crypto Transactions Exposed by Anti-Corruption Probe</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-lawmakers-traded-98m-in-crypto-over-past-3-years.htm">recent investigation</a> by the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission in South Korea has uncovered substantial cryptocurrency trading activities among the country&#8217;s lawmakers.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, they collectively traded virtual assets worth approximately 125.6 billion won ($97.6 million). The findings were based on a 90-day inspection of transaction records of all 298 sitting lawmakers from May 30, 2020, to May 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The commission&#8217;s <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20231229002600315">report</a> identified 18 lawmakers who owned virtual assets, with 11 engaging in active trading. The buying and selling transactions of these lawmakers amounted to 62.5 billion won ($48.4 million) and 63.1 billion won ($48.8 million), respectively.</p>
<p>Among the various cryptocurrencies traded, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/microstrategys-michael-saylor-to-sell-216-million-company-shares-for-bitcoin.htm">Bitcoin</a> was the most popular. The report also revealed a diverse portfolio of virtual assets, encompassing 107 different types. One lawmaker was identified as conducting 49 crypto transactions without reporting them, citing a closed exchange account.</p>

<p>Per the media outlet <a href="https://www.newsis.com/view/?id=NISX20240103_0002578991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsis</a>, the city collected the combined sum from 298 people.</p>

<p>Citizens will likely be given the choice of paying tax bills and associated fines or seeing their coins liquidated and sold off.</p>

<p>Incheon‚Äôs tax service also confiscated a range of other assets, including bonds, bank safety deposit boxes, and ‚Äúhidden financial assets at secondary financial institutions.‚Äù</p>
<p>In total, the city raised over $43.6 million from tax evaders living in Incheon in FY 2023.</p>

Kim Sang-gil, Incheon City&#8217;s financial planning chief, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúIn the future, we plan to carry out further, rigid [tax] collection operations against unscrupulous, chronic, and malicious tax evaders. We will continue to add new collection techniques to [&#8230;] boost the city‚Äôs finances and implement tax justice.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Since 2021, Incheon has launched two dedicated tax evasion-related teams of investigators.</p>
<p>The city has also added a suite of ‚Äúseven‚Äù new high-tech tools to help it detect tax evaders.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency investment products witnessed substantial inflows, totaling $243 million in the final week of 2023, contributing to a cumulative yearly inflow of $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/jbutterfill/status/1742520412775350537">CoinShares</a>, Bitcoin (BTC) led the way with over $1.9 billion in inflows, accounting for 86% of the total. Solana (SOL) followed as the second-highest, with $167 million in inflows.</p>

<p>However, multi-asset and Binance Coin (BNB) exchange-traded products (ETP) experienced net outflows of $18 million and $1 million, respectively.</p>
<p>When compared to the previous year, crypto investment products in 2023 saw higher inflows than in 2022. In 2022, Bitcoin funds attracted $388 million, making up 47.5% of the $816 million total. Multi-assets followed with $272 million, while Binance Coin experienced an outflow of $24 million.</p>
<p>The trend in crypto investment products shifted positively during the week of September 29, marking the beginning of the current bull market. Prior to that, these products faced outflows in eight of the previous nine weeks.</p>
<p>Exchange-traded products (ETPs) showed an interesting trend, with multi-asset and Binance Coin (BNB) ETPs registering net outflows of $18 million and $1 million, respectively. The data reflects investors&#8217; diverse preferences within the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h2><b>Bitcoin Reaches $45,000, Highest Level Since April 2022</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin&#8217;s upward trajectory continued into the new year, reaching $45,000 on January 2, marking its highest point since April 2022. The surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been fueled by persistent anticipation for the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a development that has been widely anticipated for several months.</p>
<p>The market&#8217;s interest in cryptocurrency investment products aligns with the broader expectation of the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-breaks-45k-etf-approval-looms-ais-100k-forecast.htm">Bitcoin&#8217;s price surpassed $45,000</a> as the crypto community awaits potential approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for one or more of the 14 pending applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>The last time Bitcoin traded above $45,000 was nearly 20 months ago, on April 5, 2022. Following that period, Bitcoin entered a prolonged bear market, reaching as low as $15,600.</p>
<p>However, recent market volatility has been evident, with over <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/over-460-million-longs-liquidated-in-past-hour-as-bitcoin-drops-8-on-spot-etf-delay-rumors.htm">$460 million in longs liquidated</a> across the crypto market after Bitcoin&#8217;s price dropped by 8% on rumors of a potential SEC delay in approving spot ETFs. Long traders suffered approximately $462 million in losses across major centralized exchanges over the past few hours.</p>
<p>Notably, the liquidations come amid reports that the SEC might reject spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The rumor led to significant market movements, with Bitcoin&#8217;s price dropping to as low as $40,000. Crypto exchanges OKX, Binance, and Huobi witnessed the highest share of liquidations.</p>
<p>Notably, Multi-Asset and Binance exchange-traded products (ETP) bucked the trend, experiencing net outflows of $18 million and $1 million, respectively. When comparing the year-to-year data, 2023 surpassed 2022 in terms of higher inflows into digital asset investment products.</p>
<p>While analysts on the X platform suggest that Bitcoin may not experience a significant rally on the day of an ETF approval due to decreasing implied volatility, some traders remain optimistic. Scott Melkor, with a large following on X, predicts that Bitcoin, currently forming a &#8220;bull pennant,&#8221; could rise as high as $54,000 in the days following a potential SEC approval.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/290000-s-korean-public-sector-employees-forced-to-declare-crypto-holdings.htm">South Korean</a> gaming firm WeMade has been hit with a $41 million tax bill for its crypto-related activities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20240103121400017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yonhap</a> reported that the National Tax Service (NTS) issued the bill following an investigation into the firm‚Äôs historic crypto business operations.</p>
<p>The NTS said it had issued the bill ‚Äúas a result of the Central Regional Tax Office‚Äôs integrated corporate tax investigation‚Äù into the firm ‚Äúfor the period 2019 to 2022.‚Äù</p>
<p>The tax body said WeMade‚Äôs payment deadline was February 29, adding that the surcharge to equity ratio was 10.05%.</p>
<p>WeMade is one of the nation‚Äôs keenest blockchain gaming proponents. The company created a blockchain and crypto-focused subsidiary named Wemade Tree in 20218.</p>
<p>WeMade initially spun this firm off, but in February last year, reabsorbed it into its parent company.</p>
<p>The firm also launched a cryptoasset named WEMIX. The coin has experienced mixed fortunes, running into a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/no-possibility-that-wemix-will-delisted-s-korea-says-gaming-giant-wemade.htm">circulation data-related controversy</a> that resulted in multiple domestic delistings in late 2022.</p>

<p>The Ethereum Foundation has <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/01/03/devcon-sea-announcement">announced</a> that Devcon 7, the Ethereum developer conference, will be hosted in Bangkok, Thailand, from November 12 to 15, 2024. The decision reflects an expansion of the event&#8217;s vision, with a focus on embracing the entire Southeast Asia region as the stage for the community gathering.</p>
<p>The Ethereum Foundation expressed its excitement about the potential and rapid growth of the Ethereum community in Southeast Asia. The decision to schedule Devcon 7 for 2024 allows for a more significant impact on regional Ethereum communities. The Foundation aims to engage more deeply with local communities, providing support and empowerment in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, Devcon 7 will be a more inclusive and regionally focused event, and to reflect this vision, it will be called &#8220;Devcon Southeast Asia&#8221; rather than being named after the host city. The event is expected to resonate across Southeast Asia, showcasing the vibrant Ethereum community in the region.</p>
<p>The choice of Bangkok, Thailand, as the host city aligns with the region&#8217;s significant potential and rapid growth in cryptocurrency adoption. The Ethereum community in countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand ranks highly in the Global Crypto Adoption Index, underscoring the pivotal role of Southeast Asia in the global Ethereum landscape.</p>
<p>The decision to focus on Southeast Asia is driven not only by the region&#8217;s significant potential and rapid cryptocurrency adoption but also by its diverse cultures, rich histories, and vibrant communities.¬†</p>
<p>&#8220;Devcon Southeast Asia&#8221; aims to resonate across the region, showcasing the vibrant Ethereum community and enveloping the diverse cultures and energy of Southeast Asia. The chosen host city, Bangkok, Thailand, with its unique blend of tradition and modernity, is considered an ideal location in terms of venue suitability and global accessibility. The event is expected to provide a platform for meaningful engagement with local communities and further empower the Ethereum ecosystem in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>As of the latest update, the live <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> (ETH) price is $2,218.64 USD, reflecting a 5.78% decrease in the last 24 hours.</p>
<h2><strong>Ethereum Foundation&#8217;s Road to Devcon Grants Foster Community Growth in Southeast Asia</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a bid to support and nurture Ethereum events, grassroots communities, and educational initiatives in Southeast Asia, the Ethereum Foundation (EF) initiated <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/06/29/road-to-devcon7-grants">the Road to Devcon (RTD)</a> Grants round on June 29, 2023. The grant round is specifically aimed at individuals based in Southeast Asia who are actively building communities, developing educational activities, and contributing to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem in the region.</p>
<p>The EF encouraged applicants to propose smaller meet-ups instead of large events, with the maximum grant awarded being $1,000. The initiative aims to empower the Southeast Asian Ethereum community by providing support along the Road to Devcon. The application deadline for the grants was set for November 30, 2023, at 23:59 UTC.</p>
<p>According to the recent announcement, the EF expressed satisfaction with the enthusiastic response and innovative proposals received from countries such as Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, and other neighboring Southeast Asian nations. The grants serve as a means to recognize and support the efforts of individuals and projects that contribute to shaping the Ethereum ecosystem in the region.</p>
<h2><strong>Vietnam Tops Southeast Asia in Global Crypto Adoption Index</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to recent research by Chainalysis, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vietnam-ranks-1st-in-crypto-adoption-usa-is-5th-china-back-in-top-10-chainalysis.htm">Vietnam</a> has emerged as a leader in cryptocurrency adoption within Southeast Asia, securing the top spot in the region and claiming the third position globally in the Global Crypto Adoption Index for 2023. This index is determined based on transaction volumes and protocols, taking into account web traffic patterns and weighting factors such as population size and purchasing power.</p>
<p>Vietnam&#8217;s robust performance in the Global Crypto Adoption Index highlights the country&#8217;s growing enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The research places other Southeast Asian nations in varying positions, with the Philippines, Indonesia, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/thailand/">Thailand</a> securing the 6th, 7th, and 10th spots, respectively. Notably, Singapore lags at the 77th position.</p>
<p>The competition among Southeast Asian countries to establish themselves as crypto hubs is evident, with each nation adopting different regulatory approaches to balance the potential of Web3 with safe and efficient practices. While Singapore and Thailand have implemented stricter measures, Vietnam&#8217;s favorable ranking suggests its positive reception and adoption of cryptocurrencies within the region.</p>

<p>Seychelles-based cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Bitget has seen prolific growth in its employee and user base in 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bitget.com/en-GB/blog/articles/2024-crypto-year-open-letter-from-gracy">According to its recently released year-end report</a>, the crypto exchange Bitget has reported aggressive workforce expansion and a significant increase in its user base during 2023. The company&#8217;s team grew from 1,100 to 1,500 employees, reflecting a substantial leap in its growth trajectory.</p>
<p>This expansion aims to provide enhanced support across Bitget&#8217;s operations, particularly in the fast-growing spot markets. This aggressive hiring initiative is in contrast to the employment cuts observed in some other cryptocurrency firms during the recent market downturn.</p>
<p>Additionally, Bitget also witnessed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchange-bitget-records-20-surge-in-new-users-with-89-buying-bitcoin-in-december.htm">more than double its user base</a>, growing from 8 million to 20 million in 2023. The new users, predominantly from Generation Z, indicate the platform&#8217;s popularity among younger demographics.</p>
<p>Bitget emphasized its commitment to delivering superior customer support with a user-centric approach, having engaged with and assisted 600,000 users through online customer service and the recovery of over 495,000 USDT in missing assets.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency trading platform also reported substantial growth in spot trading volumes in 2023, with a year-over-year increase of 94%. For instance, the platform&#8217;s volume at the beginning of the year was $15.3 billion, and by November 2023, it had grown to almost $30 billion, marking a significant increase.</p>
<p>The company initially focused on crypto derivatives and strategically reopened its spot markets in 2021, a move that proved successful in capturing market demand.</p>
<p>Sandra Chen, CEO of Bitget, highlighted the company&#8217;s strategic shift, stating,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Though originally focused on futures products, we reopened the spot market. In 2023, we went all-in on spot trading, and our efforts have paid off significantly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Notably, the decision to prioritize spot trading contributed to Bitget&#8217;s rapid growth and established it as a major player in the cryptocurrency exchange space. Additionally, the platform introduced 355 new coin listings in 2023, representing a 46% year-on-year increase in offerings.</p>
<h2><b>Bitget Continues Global Expansion Amid Industry Challenges and Regulatory Developments</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The crypto industry experienced both triumphs and obstacles, with the aftermath of the FTX collapse, industry security concerns, and regulatory frameworks dominating discussions.</p>
<p>Bitget aims to lead the way in global crypto adoption. The research team and listing team actively follow the market, seeking potential projects and introducing different zones in the spot market, including BRC20, AI, and more.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, Bitget implemented various strategic initiatives, including rebranding the BitKeep wallet to the Bitget Wallet after the acquisition. The platform also introduced a swap offering to enhance multi-chain trading capabilities.</p>
<p>Additionally, Bitget launched a fund called EmpowerX in the second half of the year, with a capital base of $100 million, aimed at investing in various cryptocurrency projects.</p>
<p>The exchange is aiming to expand its operations and attract more users in the face of tough competition from rival exchanges. In 2023, market leader Binance experienced declining figures due to the broader market downturn and regulatory challenges, leading to a<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-faces-market-share-decline-as-crypto-market-surges-whats-going-on.htm"> consecutive decrease in its market share</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, Bitget has obtained virtual asset service provider registration in Poland and Lithuania as part of its expansion into Europe. It also stated that it plans to establish a regional hub for operations in Dubai.</p>
<p>Bitget has also faced challenges in recent times with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchange-bitget-to-cease-operations-in-hong-kong-whats-going-on.htm">decision to leave Hong Kong</a>, abandoning plans to obtain a license, and announcing the closure of business on December 13. Amidst the challenges, Bitget&#8217;s wallet is set to enter the Turkish market, capitalizing on the country&#8217;s increasing crypto adoption driven by growing inflation.</p>
<p>However, Bitget&#8217;s native token, BGB, experienced exceptional growth in 2023. Starting the year at $0.18, BGB reached an all-time high of $0.70499 in December, marking a remarkable 291% surge. BGB became one of the top 5 CEX platform tokens by market capitalization.</p>

<p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100652X1574425&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.4.2-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fpolicy%2F2024%2F01%2F03%2Feu-banking-watchdog-to-deepen-probe-of-links-between-banks-crypto-entities-ft%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2Fc7239712-fc92-48ec-8438-dafd108bbb44&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=-60&amp;xuuid=930573cc47523968952b9f988af61ecd&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">set to implement</a> additional measures to evaluate the potential impact of strains in non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), including those in the cryptocurrency sector, on traditional banks. This initiative is driven by concerns over contagion and aims to enhance the understanding of interconnections between banks and other financial entities.</p>
<p>As a pivotal entity ensuring the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets in the European Union (EU), the EBA conducts biennial stress tests on European lenders. These tests assess the balance sheet exposures of banks to non-banks and contribute to the overall evaluation of systemic risk in the EU financial system. The EU-wide stress tests are conducted in collaboration with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the Financial Stability Board.</p>
<p>The move to include assessments of non-bank financial institutions, including those in the cryptocurrency space, is a response to the evolving financial landscape and the need to comprehensively understand potential risks and linkages within the broader financial system. The EBA&#8217;s stress tests serve as a supervisory tool, providing insights into the resilience of financial institutions to adverse market developments and informing supervisory decisions.</p>
<p>In 2023, the EBA conducted stress tests involving 70 banks from 16 EU and European Economic Area (EEA) countries, representing a significant portion of EU banks&#8217; total assets. The transparency and detailed results of these stress tests contribute to the Pillar 2 assessment of banks and aid in the overall risk assessment of the EU financial system.</p>
<p>The transparency templates for the 2023 EU-wide stress test include detailed results, offering information on Pillar 2 Requirements (P2R) for each bank at the end of 2022 and serving as the starting point for the stress test. The stress test results contribute to supervisory decisions and the overall evaluation of systemic risk within the EU financial system.</p>
<h2><b>EBA Expands Scrutiny to Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) and Cryptocurrencies in Ongoing Regulatory Framework Updates</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Jos√© Manuel Campa, EBA Chair, highlighted the need to &#8220;dig deeper into the links between banks and other financial firms.&#8221; The EBA plans to expand its analysis to have a comprehensive understanding of the underlying chain in NBFIs.</p>
<p>NBFIs globally hold approximately $219 trillion, accounting for almost half of the world&#8217;s financial assets, according to the Financial Times report.</p>
<p>In November, the EBA took steps to address the role of cryptocurrencies by publishing draft rules on liquidity and capital requirements for stablecoin issuers in line with the EU&#8217;s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the EBA proposed rules for vetting individuals with stakes of over 10% in a crypto company for convictions or sanctions and advised crypto companies to be vigilant against potential money laundering involving privacy coins or self-hosted wallets.</p>
<p>Assuming the consultation process proceeds smoothly, the updated guidelines are expected to take effect on December 30, 2024.</p>
<p>The new consultation paper comes after the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/eba-and-esma-release-consultation-paper-on-assessing-suitability-for-crypto-asset-service-providers-1.htm">EBA released another paper in October</a>, that assessed the suitability of management body members and stakeholders for issuing asset-referenced tokens and CASPs.</p>
<p>In July, the EBA also <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/eba-releases-liquidity-guidelines-for-stablecoin-issuers.htm">urged stablecoin issuers</a> to voluntarily adhere to specific guiding principles related to risk management and consumer protection. The official proposal by the EBA outlined that the stablecoin liquidity guidelines would serve as a liquidity stress test for stablecoin issuers.</p>
<p>The EBA anticipates that the stress test will reveal any deficiencies and insufficient liquidity in the stablecoin, enabling the authority to approve only fully-backed stablecoins with an adequate liquidity buffer. Once approved, the guidelines are expected to take effect in early 2024.</p>
<p>After implementation, the authorities will have the authority to enhance the liquidity requirements of the relevant issuer to address identified risks based on the outcomes of the liquidity stress testing. Currently, the proposal is in the consultation phase, allowing the general public to provide input, and the public consultation phase is open for three months until a public hearing is scheduled for January 30, 2024.</p>

<p>The monthly spot trading volume on crypto exchanges exceeded $1 trillion in December 2023, marking the first time this significant volume level has been surpassed in over a year.</p>
<p>According to data from compiled by <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/269991/crypto-exchange-volume-cracks-1-trillion-for-first-time-since-late-2022">The Block</a>, the total exchange volume for the month reached a whopping $1.1 trillion.</p>
<p>The last instance of monthly spot trading volume surpassing the $1 trillion mark occurred in September 2022, with a total volume of $1.03 trillion, the data showed.</p>
<p>The latest figures for December 2023 not only represent a notable resurgence but also set a new monthly record since May 2022 when trading volume peaked at $1.35 trillion.</p>
<p>As usual, the crypto exchange responsible for the most trading volume was Binance, contributing 39.3% of the December‚Äôs total volume.</p>
<p>In US dollar terms, Binance‚Äôs share of the volume equaled $432.7 billion.</p>
<p>South Korea-based crypto exchange Upbit secured the second position with an 8.3% share, amounting to $91.8 billion, followed closely by OKX at 8%, totaling $87.5 billion.</p>
<p>Binance has long dominated the rankings as the largest spot crypto exchange by trading volume, but has seen its market share drop as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-markets-chop-as-reports-emerge-that-us-doj-wants-4-billion-from-binance-to-settle-yearlong-investigation-heres-the-latest.htm">regulatory scrutiny of the exchange</a> has intensified.</p>

<p>Popular crypto phishing scams drained almost $300 million from 320,000 users in 2023 with figures increasing monthly as bad actors deploy sophisticated techniques.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://drops.scamsniffer.io/post/scam-sniffer-2023-crypto-phishing-scams-drain-300-million-from-320000-users/">recent publication</a>, cryptocurrency security firm, Scam Sniffers analyzed the market trends in the previous year stressing the activities of bad actors amid growing asset prices and extensive regulatory activities.</p>

<p>&mdash; Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) <a href="https://twitter.com/realScamSniffer/status/1741738619927466223?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to the report wallet drainers deployed on phishing websites achieved some ‚Äúlevel of success‚Äù¬† tricking users into signing big false transactions leading to loss of assets and more regulatory scrutiny in the markets.</p>
<p>‚Äú<i>Over the past year, phishing activities have steadily increased each month with phishing scammers employing more sophisticated tactics to evade security measures. Scam Sniffer has made findings on ‚ÄúWallet Drainers‚Äù that warrant the industry‚Äôs full attention.‚Äù</i><i>¬†</i></p>
<p>In total, wallet drainer scams recorded took out $295 million from 324,000 victims last year with airdrops and hacking incidents seen in several months. Notably, March saw larger activities linked to the price fluctuations of USD Circle.</p>
<p>Attacks on March 11 surged an excess of $6 million following the fluctuations in USDC rates as people interacted with fake USDC websites.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-146891" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704279539-image-8-1024x535-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="535" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704279539-image-8-1024x535-1.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704279539-image-8-1024x535-1-300x157.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704279539-image-8-1024x535-1-768x401.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704279539-image-8-1024x535-1-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>A growth in drainer services</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Although the year saw drainers exit the market, they were often replaced by new ones. A typical example was when Inferno Drainer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-scam-kit-inferno-drainer-shuts-down-operations.htm">announced an exit</a> and Angel drainers entered the scene.</p>
<p>Per the report, drainers deploy new and existing techniques to gain traction like paid Google and social media scams getting users to string along the fake websites.</p>
<p>Fake airdrops have been singled out as a major form of fraud utilized by bad actors to gain community traction as if they were interacting with the protocol. Others include Discord links and Twitter comment sections while straightforward hacking techniques involve compromising a platform‚Äôs official social media platform or simply attacking the project‚Äôs library.</p>
<p>‚Äú<i>Although hacking attacks have a broad impact, the community often reacts promptly, typically within 10-50 minutes. However, airdrops, organic traffic, paid advertising, and taken-over Discord links are much less noticeable,‚Äù </i>the report added.</p>
<h2>Highest wallet drainers in 2023</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite the numerous enlightening efforts and regulatory activities in the market, wallet drainers explored millions of users. Inferno Drainer was on the top of the list with $81 million stolen from 134,000 users.</p>
<p>MS and Angel Drainer were next on the ladder with $59 million and $20 million from 63,000 and 30,000 respectively. Other drainers that exploited millions of users include Monkey, Venom, and Pink Drainer.</p>
<p>Overall, cryptocurrency scams witnessed decreasing numbers compared to 2022 figures of $4 billion. Blockchain security firm Beosin <a href="https://x.com/beosinalert/status/1742058268456091702?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">reported reduced scams</a> across all sectors of the industry with September and November being the months that recorded the most illicit activities.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/heres-why-gamers-are-splurging-on-square-enixs-quirky-nft-characters.htm"><strong>Square Enix</strong></a> reaffirmed its plans to utilize blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and metaverse in creating novel content for consumers.</p>
<p>The <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> publisher&#8217;s Representative Director and President, Takashi Kiryu, has written <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2024/html/a_new_years_letter_from_the_president_4.html">a New Year&#8217;s letter</a> outlining the 2024 plans.</p>
<p>He noted that a change was occurring in the realm of digital entertainment &#8211; the realm of the company&#8217;s core business &#8211; throughout 2023.</p>
<p>Kiryu wrote that &#8220;we saw the release of eye-catching products and services in multiple domains where the commercialization and adoption of emerging technologies had seemed a more distant eventuality.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company identified three focus investment fields for new business domains in 2023. This year, it redefined the mission and goals for these areas: <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/etherscan-officially-acquires-solscan.htm">blockchain</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/2024-the-year-ai-and-crypto-converge-major-boom-incoming.htm">AI</a>, and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/varas-new-leadership-in-dubai-marks-next-phase-of-crypto-regulation.htm">metaverse</a>.</p>
<h2>Continuing Work on Blockchain Gaming</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2023/html/a_new_years_letter_from_the_president_3.html">Last year&#8217;s letter</a> spent many more lines discussing blockchain than this year&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The then-President Yosuke Matsuda said that, among the three investment fields, the company was the most focused on blockchain entertainment. Square Enix &#8220;devoted aggressive investment and business development efforts&#8221; to it.</p>
<p>He stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we consider traditional gaming to have been centralized, then blockchain gaming must operate based on a self-sustaining decentralized model. It is that concept, that philosophy that I see to be key.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He further opined that blockchain gained &#8220;significant recognition as a field&#8221; in 2022. The proof for this, he said, is that the term &#8216;Web3&#8217; became &#8220;a firmly established buzzword&#8221; in business circles.</p>
<p>Matsuda also noted the Japanese government&#8217;s support for the development of the blockchain and Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>The latest letter simply added that the company is working to modify its organizational structure and optimize resource allocations to support the efforts outlined in 2023.</p>
<h2>Aggressive in Applying AI</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This year&#8217;s letter outlined AI and metaverse ideas in more detail.</p>
<p>While AI was a subject of academic debate for a long while, the introduction of <strong>ChatGPT</strong> changed everything, Kiryu argued.</p>
<p>It initiated a fast spread of generative AIs and showed that their applicability was not limited to text. A &#8220;quick succession of launches&#8221; of services and content followed, expanding generative AI into numerous digital entertainment-related areas, such as images, video, and music.</p>
<p>Kiryu stated that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We also intend to be aggressive in applying AI and other cutting-edge technologies to both our content development and our publishing functions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Generative AI has the potential to reshape what the company creates and the process to do so, including programming, he argued.</p>
<p>Technological innovation represents business opportunities, Kiryu said. Therefore, in the longer term, Square Enix plans to leverage AI and other novel tech to create new forms of content.</p>
<h2>Fusing Real World and Metaverse</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Lastly, Kiryu noted that extended reality (XR) expanded beyond business applications for the metaverse and other virtual spaces.</p>
<p>In 2023, new services merged virtual spaces with the real world.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the realm of digital entertainment, where the focus has been on pioneering the development of new content, the experiential value of digital content itself increased dramatically as devices came to market that were capable of delivering even more immersive, realistic experiences using virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The next step, Kiryu said, is to apply these technologies to new forms of content that fuse the real and virtual worlds.</p>

<p>The Delhi Police have initiated a cheating case against crypto app CoinDCX, following complaints from users about alleged bank fraud. However, India&#8217;s largest crypto exchange CoinDCX clarified that the fraud did not occur on their platform but rather on a fake app impersonating their name.</p>
<p>As per a <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-police-lodge-cheating-fir-against-crypto-investment-firm-9092636/">local news report</a>, complainants reported instances where they were asked to pay additional funds when attempting to withdraw their crypto investments online. The police are investigating the matter after combining three to four complaints from November last year.</p>
<h2>CoinDCX Clarifies Against Clone Crypto Platforms</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In response to the allegations, CoinDCX issued a statement to CryptoNews, asserting that the reported fraud did not transpire on their authentic platform. The complaints were directed towards a counterfeit crypto app that replicated CoinDCX&#8217;s name, deceiving users.</p>
<p>Police complaints were filed by victims who were duped out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in bank frauds by fake CoinDCX app.</p>
<p>The filed FIR states that an SHO-level officer conducted an inquiry, and a &#8220;cognizable&#8221; offense has been identified.</p>
<h2>Fake Website Scams Rampant in Industry</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
CoinDCX clarified in their statement that no such fraudulent incident occurred on their official app or website. The exchange highlighted the prevalence of fake websites and URLs in the industry, mimicking financial apps to deceive users.</p>
<p>CoinDCX, reinforcing their commitment to user security, noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We want to reiterate that the safety and security of users&#8217; funds are our absolute top priorities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The exchange has reported threats to the responsible authorities and continues efforts to educate users on potential scams.</p>
<p>Despite the unsettling nature of such incidents, CoinDCX emphasized the importance of user vigilance and urged prompt reporting of anything suspicious, collaborating with the community to maintain a secure and trustworthy environment. CoinDCX&#8217;s security team has identified and reported over 80 fraudulent websites/URLs impersonating their name in recent times.</p>
<p>India is seeing a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/india-struggles-curb-rising-crypto-frauds-victims-left-legal-abyss-amid-regulatory-ambiguity.htm">massive rise in crypto-related fraud</a> activities recently.</p>

<p>Radiant Capital has confirmed a security breach in its network, leading to the theft of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-proposes-simplified-ethereum-proof-of-stake-design.htm">Ethereum</a> valued at approximately $4.5 million.</p>
<p>According to the blockchain security company <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1742334242120466580">PeckShield Inc.</a>, the hacker drained 1,900 Ethereum tokens within six seconds after a new market was activated on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/decentralized-bitcoin-mining-pool-ocean-successfully-mines-third-block-in-ongoing-quest.htm">decentralized</a> platform. To analyze what exactly happened during the exploitation, PeckShield published a post to explain.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe root cause is not new: It basically exploits a time window when a new market is activated in a lending market (forked from the popular Compound/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/aave-rebrands-to-avara-announces-latest-acquisition-in-web3.htm">Aave</a>),‚Äù wrote the post. ‚ÄúThe exploitation also relies on a known rounding issue in current Compound/Aave codebase.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSpecifically, today&#8217;s actor ‚Ä¶ sniped the new <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-to-list-10-usdc-trading-pairs-on-its-spot-market-heres-more.htm">USDC</a> market deployment and exploited it *6 seconds* after the activation,‚Äù wrote PeckShield.</p>

<h2>Orbit Chain Hit by $82 Million Hack in Cross-Chain Bridge Exploit</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Orbit Chain&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/orbit-suspends-cross-chain-bridge-contract-after-82m-exploit.htm">Orbit Bridge</a> service has also experienced a significant security breach, resulting in an $82 million loss. The hack, which occurred just before New Year&#8217;s, prompted the suspension of the cross-chain bridge contract.</p>
<p>Initial reports of unusual activity on Orbit Chain Bridge came from a <a href="https://twitter.com/KGJRTG/status/1741575860635783385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1741575860635783385%7Ctwgr%5Ea0f94ec33d179465eabd7a17faae1b397696e307%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptonews.com%2Fnews%2Forbit-suspends-cross-chain-bridge-contract-after-82m-exploit.htm">social media user</a> on Dec. 31. The hackers carried out five transactions, transferring substantial amounts of USDT, USDC, Ethereum, WBTC, and DAI into new wallets, as detailed by Arkham Intelligence.</p>
<p>In response to the exploit, Orbit Chain suspended the bridge contract and began on-chain negotiations with the hackers. Investigations are ongoing to understand more about the breach and track the stolen assets.</p>
