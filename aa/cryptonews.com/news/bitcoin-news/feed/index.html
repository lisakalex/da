<p class="p-rich_text_section">The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with significant developments as <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a> grapples with market volatility. On Thursday, Bitcoin&#8217;s price saw a notable decrease, dropping by nearly 4.50% to $43,000. Amidst this price fluctuation, major financial players like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are engaging in talks with Grayscale about the role of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">Meanwhile, Tuttle Capital has put forward a recommendation for six ETFs that aim to enhance the performance of Bitcoin ETFs. In a strategic move, Cipher Mining has acquired an additional 16,700 miners, gearing up for the anticipated Bitcoin halving event.</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">These events collectively paint a dynamic picture of the Bitcoin market, highlighting the interplay between investment strategies and the technological backbone of cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2 class="p-rich_text_section">JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs in Talks with Grayscale for Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">Grayscale Investments, a leading crypto asset manager, is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-03/jpmorgan-goldman-talking-to-grayscale-about-bitcoin-etf-role?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=crypto">reportedly</a> in discussions with major financial institutions like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs about their potential roles in Grayscale&#8217;s proposed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">As authorized participants, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs would have the authority to create and redeem the fund&#8217;s shares, a critical function for maintaining liquidity and aligning ETF share prices with the underlying assets.</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">While neither company has commented on these talks, the development echoes BlackRock&#8217;s choice of JPMorgan Securities as an authorized participant for its Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">This increasing institutional involvement in cryptocurrencies could significantly influence Bitcoin prices and further integrate digital currencies into mainstream finance.</p>
<h2 class="p-rich_text_section">Tuttle Capital Targets Enhanced Bitcoin ETF Performance</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">Tuttle Capital Management has filed for six new ETFs aimed at amplifying returns relative to a standard spot Bitcoin ETF. These ETFs, including T-REX 1.5X and 2X Long Spot Bitcoin Daily Target ETFs, are designed to offer daily inverse or leveraged returns of up to 150% or 200%.</p>
<p class="p-rich_text_section">Initially tied to BlackRock&#8217;s proposed iShares spot Bitcoin ETF, Tuttle may revise the reference asset in the future. These leveraged ETFs, set for a March 18, 2024 effective date, could introduce heightened volatility in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, influenced by market reception and investor engagement.</p>
<h2 class="p-rich_text_section">Cipher Mining Boosts Operations with 16,700 New Miners</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span>
</div>
<p class="p-rich_text_section"><a href="https://www.ciphermining.com">Cipher Mining</a> has strategically bolstered its operations with the purchase of 16,700 Avalon miners from Canaan, scheduled for Q2 delivery ahead of Bitcoin&#8217;s anticipated April halving. This acquisition aims to enhance Cipher&#8217;s mining capacity to 8.4 EH/s, as the halving often correlates with Bitcoin price increases.</p>

<p class="p-rich_text_section">The miners will be distributed across Cipher&#8217;s Texas facilities, augmenting each site&#8217;s capacity by 30 megawatts.

<h2>Bitcoin Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On January 4th, Bitcoin&#8217;s market exhibits continued volatility, now trading at a slightly higher level of $42,950, following a recent 5% drop. This fluctuation reflects ongoing market uncertainties, especially regarding regulatory developments.</p>
<p>Key technical indicators show Bitcoin&#8217;s pivot point at $42,483. Overcoming resistance levels at $43,658, $44,877, and $45,966 could signal a bullish trend revival. Conversely, support levels at $41,285, $40,393, and $39,348 are crucial in preventing further declines. The RSI stands at 40, suggesting a bearish sentiment, and Bitcoin remains below its 50-Day EMA of $43,350, reinforcing the bearish trend.</p>

<p>The technical outlook suggests potential buying opportunities above the $42,000 mark. However, continued bearish candle closures below the 50 EMA may intensify selling. The short-term forecast is cautiously optimistic above $42,000, but the market is sensitive to regulatory and economic influences, requiring investor vigilance for clearer market direction.</p>

<p>There are many retailers accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment and realizing how important it is to attract and tap into a more tech-savvy client base.</p>
<p>Some would argue that the end of fiat currencies is nigh, and eventually, fiat will be replaced by digital currencies. If we already have a fiat payment system why change this and what are the advantages of using digital currencies for retail transactions?</p>
<p>Data from Deloitte <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/audit/us-corporates-using-crypto-pov.pdf">reported roughly</a> 2,352 US businesses accepted Bitcoin in late 2022, and that doesn’t include Bitcoin ATMs. An increasing number of companies worldwide are using Bitcoin and other crypto and digital assets for a host of investment, operational, and transactional purposes.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>Benefits of Using Cryptocurrency in Retail</b></p>
<p><b></b>Using digital currencies for transactions offers several advantages such as speed. Digital currency transactions can be completed instantly or in a matter of seconds, compared to traditional banking systems which can take days.</p>
<p>Digital currencies can reduce or eliminate the need for intermediaries, leading to lower transaction fees for retailers. Cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized platform, making international transactions smoother without the need for currency conversion.<b></b></p>
<p>Then there is the issue of security – blockchain technology, which underpins many digital currencies allows for enhanced security features. This in turn can protect both retailers and customers from fraud and unauthorized transactions. <b></b></p>
<p>Another factor is reduced fraud risks. The immutable nature of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">blockchain</a> ensures that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered, reducing the risk of chargebacks and fraudulent activities.</p>
<h4><b>Financial Inclusion</b></h4>
<p>For the underprivileged cryptocurrency has the potential to foster financial inclusion and improve access to financial services especially those in developing countries. Financial inclusion is important and digital currencies can provide banking services to the unbanked or underbanked populations, potentially expanding the customer base for retailers.</p>
<p>Through accepting digital payments retailers can offer innovative payment solutions, such as loyalty programs, or smart contract-based transactions using digital currencies.</p>
<h4><strong>Transparent Transactions </strong></h4>
<p>Every transaction on the blockchain is recorded transparently, allowing for greater accountability and trust between retailers and customers. This also cuts out the need for due diligence before a huge transaction.  Digital transactions cut out the middlemen. Direct peer-to-peer transactions can eliminate the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors, reducing costs and potential points of failure.</p>
<h4><strong><b>Retailers accepting Bitcoin</b><br />
</strong></h4>
<p>So who are the most notable and prominent retailers that have embraced digital currency payments?</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><b>Microsoft:</b> This American multinational technology corporation has been accepting Bitcoin for use in its online <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30377654">Xbox Store since 2014.</a> However, the firm temporarily paused from accepting Bitcoin due to volatility in the market. Microsoft is once again accepting cryptocurrency strictly for the Xbox store credits.</li>
<li><strong>Starbucks:</strong> The coffee shop customers pay directly with Bitcoin thanks to a partnership with digital wallet <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210330005401/en/Bakkt-Launches-Its-Digital-Wallet-Bakkt-App-to-Manage-All-Forms-of-Digital-Assets-Debuting-with-Starbucks-GolfNow-and-Best-Buy-Among-Other-Marquee-Brands">provider Bakkt.</a>  In 2022, Starbucks unveiled Starbucks Odyssey becoming one of the first companies to integrate non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with a loyalty program.</li>
<li><b>Tesla: </b>SpaceX and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk has been open about his interest in Dogecoin. Tesla first began accepting crypto as a form of payment for its cars but discontinued the program soon after. However, Dogecoin is <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/dogecoin#:~:text=What%20cryptocurrency%20does%20Tesla%20accept,making%20your%20purchase%20with%20Dogecoin.">still accepting</a> some Tesla Merchandise.</li>
<li><b>Wholefoods: </b>This grocery chain, owned by Amazon, has shown interest in cryptocurrency and there have been initiatives to enable crypto payments, although the rollout was still in progress as of my last update.</li>
<li><b>Time Magazine:</b> In 2019, TIME magazine <a href="https://time.com/5955969/time-partners-with-crypto-com/">first began</a> accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment for digital subscriptions through a new partnership with <a href="https://crypto.com/">Crypto.com</a> exchange.</li>
<li><b>Virgin Galactic:</b> The space tourism venture founded by Richard Branson, is accepting bitcoins as a form of payment for space tourists. Unfortunately, Virgin Galactic has been a loss-making business announcing job cuts and a pause in commercial flights in an effort to save cash.</li>
<li><b>Overstock:</b> The e-commerce home decor firm selling bedding and furniture accepts cryptocurrency as a form of payment. This was one of the earliest major retailers to accept Bitcoin as a method of payment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>How to Shop with Cryptocurrency</b></h4>
<p>To begin shopping with cryptocurrency involves a few basic steps to ensure you have the necessary tools and knowledge to make secure transactions.  Here&#8217;s a brief guide on how to get started:</p>
<p>First of all, choose a wallet. Before you can shop with cryptocurrency, you&#8217;ll need a digital wallet to store your crypto assets. Wallets come in various forms: you can either choose a software wallet which involves an application or software installed on your computer or mobile device. The other option is a hardware wallet.</p>
<p>This is a physical device that stores your cryptocurrency offline, offering increased security.  Online wallets are web-based services that store your crypto assets on the cloud. However, these are considered less secure than hardware or software wallets.</p>
<h4><b>Acquiring Crypto</b></h4>
<p>The next step is to acquire Cryptocurrency: To start shopping, you&#8217;ll need to acquire some cryptocurrency. This can be done by using exchanges. Platforms such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken allow you to buy cryptocurrencies using traditional currencies (like USD, EUR, etc.).</p>
<p>There is the Peer-to-Peer option. This allows you to buy from individuals through platforms like LocalBitcoins or through decentralized exchanges. There are also crypto ATMs: In some locations, cryptocurrency ATMs allow you to purchase crypto using cash.</p>
<p>Next, choose a retailer that accepts cryptocurrency as a form of payment.  Not all retailers accept cryptocurrency. Look for online platforms or physical stores that have integrated crypto payments. Some popular retailers or platforms include Overstock, Shopify merchants, and various independent online stores.</p>
<h4><b>Making the Purchase</b></h4>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve selected a product or service from a retailer that accepts cryptocurrency. Next comes the fun part: Choose the cryptocurrency payment option. Enter the necessary details, which usually include the amount in crypto and a receiving address. Confirm the transaction from your wallet.</p>
<p>It’s important to monitor and manage your account. Always keep an eye on your cryptocurrency transactions. Ensure you&#8217;re sending funds to the correct address and are aware of any associated fees.</p>
<h4><b>Stay Informed </b></h4>
<p>The world of cryptocurrency is dynamic and fast-moving. Stay updated on the latest developments, security best practices, and changes in regulations.</p>
<p>Remember, while shopping with cryptocurrency can offer privacy, speed, and other benefits, it also comes with risks. Always prioritize security, ensure you&#8217;re dealing with reputable retailers, and be cautious of potential scams.</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs is expected to be the latest financial institution to take on the role of authorized participant (AP)  in two key Bitcoin ETFs, according to a new report.</p>
<h2>Traditional finance’s adoption of crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The report, published by CoinDesk early Wednesday afternoon, claims insider sources <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com">allege that the investment bank</a> is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/who-has-the-best-bitcoin-etf-blackrocks-fee-still-a-mystery.htm">looking to play a prominent role in both BlackRock</a> and Grayscale’s potential upcoming Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>Should Goldman Sachs go on to become an AP for the hopeful Bitcoin ETFs, they would join a number of firms including Jane Street, JPMorgan, and Cantor Fitzgerald who have already expressed interest in serving as APs for Bitcoin ETF applicants themselves.</p>
<p>News of Goldman Sachs’ interest in the Bitcoin ETF realm follows shortly after the cryptocurrency experienced a turbulent morning which saw its value drop by an estimated 8%. </p>
<h2>A turbulent morning</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The sudden dip in Bitcoin’s value came a<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/matrixport-analysis-sec-to-reject-etf-applications-in-january-with-final-approval-pushed-to-q2-2024.htm">midst a new report from investment services provider Matrixport</a> which s<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-to-finalize-comments-on-spot-bitcoin-etfs-with-nasdaq-nyse.htm">uggested the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> would come to reject all spot Bitcoin ETF hopefuls.</p>
<p>“While we have seen frequent meetings between the ETF applicants and staff from the SEC, which resulted in the applicants refiling their applications, we believe all applications fall short of a critical requirement that must be met before the SEC approves,” the Matrixport analysis states. “This might be fulfilled by Q2 2024, but we expect the SEC to reject all proposals in January.”</p>
<p>The organization’s report prompted a wave of backlash across social media, with many users calling for an investigation into the investment services provider for market manipulation. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">While on holiday, I have more time than usual for writing.</p>
<p>Matrixport, a small private firm based in Asia, is a considerable distance from New York, requiring a 17-hour and 55-minute flight. We don&#39;t receive insider information from U.S. regulators. To the best of my knowledge,…</p>
<p>&mdash; Jihan Wu (@JihanWu) <a href="https://twitter.com/JihanWu/status/1742620110945386574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETF approval timeline is still unclear</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“It&#8217;s unrealistic to believe that a Matrixport report could trigger a trillion $ size market to crash,” Matrixport co-founder Jihan Wu posted to X. “If someone attributes a flash crash to our report, I suggest examining the analysts&#8217; expertise more closely.”</p>
<p>Wu went on to cite “bearish views on X” and “an unexpected drop in crypto stocks for consecutive trading days” as seemingly additional potential factors in Bitcoin’s drop in value.</p>
<p>Moreover, the cryptocurrency was able to slightly recover, with its trading value hovering around a 5% decrease at the time this publication was released.</p>
<p>Overall, Goldman Sachs’ willingness to partake in the crypto industry as an AP alongside other investment banks signals a potential pathway for greater mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>However, it remains unclear when or if a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved.</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a> recently experienced a sharp decline, losing over 7% in just 24 hours, and dragging other major cryptocurrencies down with it. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, Solana, XRP, Cardano, and Avalanche all suffered significant losses following Bitcoin&#8217;s drop to below $42,000.</p>
<p>This sudden market downturn is largely attributed to the growing apprehension surrounding the upcoming decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the much-anticipated spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-amends-bitcoin-etf-application-excludes-authorized-participant-details.htm">Bitcoin ETF applications</a>.</p>
<p>Just days before, Bitcoin had witnessed a notable surge, crossing the $45,000 mark, fueled by investor optimism over the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. However, this optimism was short-lived as market sentiment turned bearish amid concerns over a possible rejection of the ETF by the SEC.</p>
<h2>Matrixport Predicts Bitcoin Drop Amid ETF Uncertainty</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The cryptocurrency market is undergoing a significant downturn, possibly linked to the expected rejection of Bitcoin spot ETFs by the U.S. SEC. Matrixport&#8217;s analysis <a href="https://www.matrixport.com/institutions/research/matrix-on-target/813?utm_source=BenchmarkEmail&amp;utm_campaign=MoT_General&amp;utm_medium=email">anticipates</a> a sharp drop in Bitcoin&#8217;s value, potentially reaching $36,000. This forecast hinges on the SEC&#8217;s likely refusal of Bitcoin spot ETF applications in January.</p>
<p>Chairman Gary Gensler&#8217;s cautious regulatory approach, combined with the Democrat-led SEC panel, is adding to the market&#8217;s uncertainty. Despite this bearish short-term outlook, Matrixport expects a positive trajectory for Bitcoin in the long term, projecting a recovery above $42,000 by the end of 2024. The pending SEC decision is causing investor wariness, influencing the current market slump.</p>
<h2>Matrixport: Market Jitters Over SEC&#8217;s ETF Decision Impact</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Matrixport, a cryptocurrency investment services firm, anticipates the U.S. SEC&#8217;s rejection of all spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The company cites the current SEC leadership&#8217;s cautious stance on crypto adoption as a key factor in this prediction. While acknowledging the potential boost in crypto adoption from ETF approval, Matrixport emphasizes Chair Gensler&#8217;s prioritization of stricter compliance.</p>
<p>The report suggests that political factors may impede Bitcoin ETF approval, viewing it as a legitimate alternative store of value. The optimism surrounding the ETF approval has previously driven a substantial increase in Bitcoin prices, with a significant influx of investment in anticipation of a positive decision.</p>
<p>In summary, the anticipated rejection of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC is likely contributing to the current uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market, affecting Bitcoin&#8217;s price and leading to caution among investors.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On January 3rd, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-breaks-45k-etf-approval-looms-ais-100k-forecast.htm">Bitcoin</a> presents a volatile scenario, recently experiencing a sharp decline of 5%, now trading at $42,645. This downturn in the leading cryptocurrency reflects broader market anxieties, particularly around regulatory uncertainties.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin&#8217;s pivot point stands at $42,483. Should it manage to overcome immediate resistances at $43,658, $44,877, and $45,966, a bullish trend could be reignited. However, support levels at $41,285, $40,393, and $39,348 loom as critical junctures to buffer against further losses.</p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 40, hovering below the neutral mark, indicating bearish sentiment. Additionally, Bitcoin&#8217;s trading below its 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $43,350, further signifies a bearish trend.</p>

<p>Technical analysis reveals that the current trendline might limit the downtrend, offering potential buying opportunities above $42,000. Yet, the closure of bearish candles under the 50 EMA could drive more selling pressure.</p>
<p>In summary, while the short-term outlook for Bitcoin is cautiously optimistic above the $42,000 threshold, the market remains vulnerable to swift changes, influenced by external regulatory and economic factors. Investors should remain attentive to these key technical levels and broader market indicators for a clearer directional cue.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A 19b-4 SEC form is used by stock exchanges and other self-regulatory organizations to record rule changes with the SEC.</p>
<p>In June 2023, Nasdaq filed for permission to list shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, inspiring a slew of fund sponsors and their relevant exchanges to file for competing Bitcoin spot ETF products.</p>
<p>Until now, the regulator has denied all such applications, with SEC chair Gary Gensler fearing that they face a greater risk of market manipulation than previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs.</p>
<p>However, following a court loss to crypto investment giant Grayscale in August, the chairman has been forced to take a “<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-gary-gensler-says-sec-taking-new-look-at-spot-btc-etfs-approval-coming.htm">fresh evaluation</a>” of all such applications.</p>
<p>Indeed, investment managers from Cathie Wood of Ark Invest to Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital have noted increased engagement from the agency regarding their spot ETF applications since the Grayscale court battle ended.</p>
<h2>When Will ETFs Be Approved by the SEC?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The SEC is required by law to officially approve or deny Ark’s ETF application before January 10. As such, given recent events, Bloomberg’s ETF analysts expect long-awaited, simultaneous approvals for most or all ETF applicants within the week.</p>
<p>Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, for example, said on Wednesday that the agency likely wouldn’t be holding meetings with stock exchanges if it wasn’t planning to approve the ETFs.</p>
<p>“When we see updated (final) 19b-4s roll in that is sign approval imminent as SEC has been doing back and forth w issuers offline to perfect their 19b-4s,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1742580887022125209">stated</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s price dropped drastically on Wednesday back to $42,000 after tapping a 21-month high at $45,500 a day prior.</p>
<p>Some community members attributed the fall to a new Matrixport article predicting that the Bitcoin ETFs will be denied by the SEC, thus stonewalling a wave of institutional capital that many investors expect such a product to attract.</p>
<p>John Palmer, the president of CBOE Digital, recently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cboe-predicts-spot-bitcoin-etfs-to-draw-investments-from-pension-funds-and-ria-based-funds.htm">predicted</a> that Bitcoin ETFs will draw new investments from both pensions and IRA-based funds.</p>

<p>A senior ETF analyst has cast doubt on the accuracy of a new report published by crypto investment services provider Matrixport alleging the SEC may very well <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/matrixport-analysis-sec-to-reject-etf-applications-in-january-with-final-approval-pushed-to-q2-2024.htm">reject all spot Bitcoin ETF applications come January</a>.</p>
<h2>“Massively out of consensus”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“People tagging me like crazy on this “rejection” report. We have heard nothing to indicate anything but approval but I want to give the guy the benefit of the doubt so I’m asking if he has any sources or if he is just speculating,” <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas">Balchunas wrote in a post on X</a>. “He seems to be a bitcoin bull and recently tweeted “executives” said approval likely. So unsure why he flipped.”</p>
<p>In response to Balchunas’ posts, Markus Thielson, head of research at Matrixport, wrote that his “report is not based on issuer, nor on SEC insider comments.”</p>
<p>While Thielson admitted to previously having bullish expectations previously, he went on to state that he “turned bearish” as of Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Obviously this is massively out of consensus,” said Thielson. “I do think the SEC will vote it down.”</p>
<h2>A whirlwind of a morning</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The exchange <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/over-460-million-longs-liquidated-in-past-hour-as-bitcoin-drops-8-on-spot-etf-delay-rumors.htm">follows a morning of turbulence for Bitcoin</a>, which dropped a whopping 8% amidst the release of Matrixport’s analysis. However, it remains unclear exactly what caused the drop in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s trading value.</p>
<p>“While we have seen frequent meetings between the ETF applicants and staff from the SEC, which resulted in the applicants refiling their applications, we believe all applications fall short of a critical requirement that must be met before the SEC approves,” the Matrixport analysis states. “This might be fulfilled by Q2 2024, but we expect the SEC to reject all proposals in January.”</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JihanWu/status/1742577001633026365?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1742577001633026365%7Ctwgr%5Eaadba326a76ceb3ba15ea2d0007de06ddf09567c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fmatrixport-founder-says-dissemination-bitcoin-etf-report-beyond-our-control">Matrixport co-founder Jihan Wu subsequently took to X</a> to state that the report’s rapid media dissemination “was not planned” by the company and is “beyond our control.”</p>
<p>“Matrixport&#8217;s analysts operate independently, expressing their opinions without any influence or interference from management,” Wu stated.</p>
<p>“In my opinion, the approval of a Spot ETF by SEC, which will attract fresh investment into Bitcoin, is inevitable,” the Matrixport co-founder assured.</p>
<h2>Accusations of market manipulation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
However, many in the crypto community are upset that the report was released at all, with several alleging that Matrixport should be looked into for market manipulation.</p>
<p>“Matrixport should be investigated for market manipulation regarding the BTC ETF denial &#8216;opinion,&#8217;” wrote one X user.</p>
<p>“If you don’t think this is market manipulation, you haven’t been here long enough,” wrote another. “Sorry to everyone that sold.”</p>
<p>However, Wu later took to X to state that it is &#8220;unrealistic to believe that a Matrixport report could trigger a trillion $ size market to crash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If someone attributes a flash crash to our report, I suggest examining the analysts&#8217; expertise more closely,&#8221; Wu wrote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-is-fully-priced-in-argues-analyst-glen-goodman.htm"> Bitcoin remained down 5%</a> at the time of this article’s publication.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency financial services company, Matrixport has projected a possible rejection of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF applications in January with final approval in the second quarter of the year.</p>
<p>In a Jan 3 <a href="https://www.matrixport.com/institutions/research/matrix-on-target/813">market research</a>, the firm gave reasons why the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will reject a spot BTC ETF this month, shifting a probable approval date to next quarter and predicting steady asset prices based on other factors.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Matrixport’s latest report released a rare view that the SEC will reject all Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, and final approval may be achieved in the Q2. It also predicts that the price of Bitcoin will fall to 36,000 to 38,000, and recommended that investors buy put options or…</p>
<p>&mdash; Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1742494652677378057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to the report, despite frequent meetings between staff of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-reportedly-overwhelmed-with-paperwork-as-deadline-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approach.htm">financial regulator and ETF applicants</a> which led to the refilling of applications, edits, and widespread projection of an imminent approval, a critical requirement remains until Q2 2024.</p>
<p>The political sphere remains pivotal to such approval and with Gary Gensler’s recent leaning and comments, more regulatory tightening needs to be done before a spot ETF will be rolled out.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>The current five-person voting Commissioners leadership critical for the ETF approval of the SEC is dominated by Democrats. SEC Chair Gensler is not embracing crypto in the US, and it might even be a very long shot to expect that he would vote to approve Bitcoin Spot ETFs.”</i><i> </i></p></blockquote>
<p>Several Democratic lawmakers have criticized the market for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-opposes-blockchain-lobbying-efforts-writes-letter-to-association-whats-going-on.htm">prevalent scams and lack of regulation</a> calling for tougher policies to protect investors and most time just being anti-crypto as described by most commentators.</p>
<p>On his part, Gensler’s approach to the cryptocurrency market has been criticized as tightening positives leading to unfriendly conditions unlike Europe as can be seen in the proliferation of court cases.</p>
<p>Analysts at Matrixport referred to Gensler’s comments in December on the number of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-ceo-brad-garlinhouse-fires-at-sec-over-crypto-noncompliance-comments.htm">bad actors in the crypto market</a> and the need for more compliance as reasons why an approval will not be seen in January.</p>
<p>Furthermore, approval will mean a regulatory nod for BTC as an alternative store of value. Either way, an approval in the second quarter still holds benefits for the market with bulls gearing towards a higher price.</p>
<h2>Denial could see a slight price correction states Matrixport</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Last year saw institutional investors go bullish on the market on the back of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/record-1-1-trillion-in-crypto-exchange-volume-driven-by-spot-bitcoin-etf-anticipation.htm">potential spot ETF approval</a> with billions pouring in across several sectors. Bitcoin institutional products inflows rose to $1.6 billion and its assets under management (AUM) surged above $36 billion.</p>
<p>However, a denial of an application will see slight liquidations from several quarters leading to a declining price, the firm wrote.</p>
<p>“<i>If there is any denial by the SEC, we could see cascading liquidations as we expect most of the $5.1 billion in additional perpetual long Bitcoin futures to be unwound. We could see Bitcoin prices declining by -20% very quickly and falling back to the $36,000/$38,000 range.”</i><i> </i></p>
<p>Matrixport has been known for its bullish stance regarding a spot BTC ETF <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-rally-to-breach-50000-this-month-matrixport.htm">previously projecting a bullish run</a> through the end of last year and a $50,000 BTC price by the end of January.</p>

Source: a video screenshot,<br />Cryptonites TV / YouTube</figcaption></figure>
<p>In a recent interview, analyst Glen Goodman, author of <strong>The Crypto Trader</strong>, discussed if a spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-veteran-lyn-alden-targets-200000-bitcoin-says-100000-would-be-disappointing-for-this-bull-market.htm">Bitcoin</a> exchange-traded fund (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-etf-decision-approaches-buy-the-rumors-sell-the-news.htm">ETF</a>) is priced in, and what could happen if the &#8220;unknown factor&#8221;, Gary Gensler, decides to delay it.</p>
<p>The market eagerly awaits the <strong>US Securities and Exchange</strong> (SEC)&#8217;s decision on approving a Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-01-02/bitcoin-etf-fully-priced-in-glen-goodman-video">Talking</a> to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Goodman argued that nearly everyone has &#8220;bought into&#8221; the idea that an ETF is coming.</p>
<p>He stated that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When it comes to it being priced in, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s pretty fully priced in, probably.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But there is a bit of a lose-lose situation, he argued. While priced in if the approval indeed comes, what happens if it doesn&#8217;t?</p>
<h2>Gary Gensler: The Unknown Factor for a Bitcoin ETF Approval</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Discussing how the SEC Chair Gary Gensler is known for cracking down on the crypto industry, Goodman stated: &#8220;Absolutely! That&#8217;s the one factor I think that people are forgetting here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He implied that Gensler&#8217;s dislike for all things crypto is not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>There are positive signs that may suggest that the approval is all but signed. This includes <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-meets-with-seven-bitcoin-etf-applicants-as-29-december-deadline-approaches-reuters.htm">recent talks</a> between the SEC officials and the ETF hopefuls.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But Gary Gensler, we know, he never has anything good to say about crypto, does he? So he is the unknown factor in all this. And frankly, he is the boss.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Goodman argued that Gensler may require the applicants to do more work, which may delay the approval.</p>
<p>As an example, Goodman gave the custody and trading separation on exchanges recently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-is-unlikely-to-change-regulatory-environment-in-the-us-more-news.htm">discussed</a> by Steve Scott and AJ Nary of digital asset custody firm <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitgo-secures-digital-asset-custody-license-in-germany.htm">BitGo</a></strong>.</p>
<h2>It Could Get Bad</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Asked how far bitcoin could drop if there is no approval soon, Goodman stated that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we get the impression from [the SEC] that the delay is open-ended as opposed to just &#8216;oh, we just want a few final things done,&#8217; then it could be really bad.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin, as seen before, is capable of &#8220;absolutely terrifying falls&#8221; that wipe out months of gains.</p>
<p>Looking at the futures funding rates on crypto exchanges, Goodman said, &#8220;there are quite frothy levels.&#8221; Many people are borrowing a lot of money now to buy BTC.</p>
<p>So if it did start falling, there could be a domino effect where accounts start getting liquidated because people have overstretched themselves &#8220;on the old leverage.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he personally is not selling, Goodman has &#8220;lightened up&#8221; his holdings after staying long for a while.</p>
<p>The price may continue to be influenced by the ETF excitement &#8211; assuming it gets approved. However, &#8220;the risk-reward is not looking so great at this level,&#8221; he opined.</p>
<p>He stressed, though, that this is just a short-term theory. BTC is known for its ability to drop and then jump back up just as fast.</p>
<p>Looking at it long-term, a Bitcoin ETF approval is &#8220;fantastic news,&#8221; as many experts have noted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other drivers for 2024, Goodman opined, include <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/immutable-eliminates-fees-in-zkevm-gaming-solution-more-news.htm">gaming</a>, artificial intelligence (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/square-enix-in-2024-doubling-down-on-blockchain-ai-and-metaverse-technologies.htm">AI</a>), and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/a-look-into-the-trending-decentralized-social-media-experien-8950.htm">decentralised social media</a>.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Well-known macro expert and crypto veteran Lyn Alden believes that a peak of $100,000 for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> during the next bull market would be a rather underwhelming outcome for the ongoing bullish cycle.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lyn Alden shared her thoughts on Bitcoin&#8217;s future price trajectory in a recent interview on the <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/lyn-alden">What Bitcoin Did</a> podcast.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">She emphasized the correlation between global liquidity and Bitcoin&#8217;s cycles, stating that the rise or fall of liquidity serves as a reliable indicator of Bitcoin&#8217;s performance. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, she also noted that this correlation does not provide a clear indication of how high or low Bitcoin&#8217;s price could go.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While liquidity offers a directional insight, estimating the magnitude of price movements is more challenging. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alden suggests that traditional models like stock-to-flow, which provide specific price predictions at certain dates, may not be as applicable to Bitcoin&#8217;s nature.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Bitcoin is highly correlated with liquidity in terms of direction, but there’s very little way to judge a price from it. It’s not really useful for magnitude, so it’s not one of those stock-to-flow models where you can say, ‘Okay, at this date it should be this price.’&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lyn Alden Expects Liquidity to Improve in 2024, 2025</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alden predicts a positive outlook for liquidity in the years 2024 and 2025, which could also benefit risk-on assets like Bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">She envisions a scenario where Bitcoin experiences a rally of approximately 340% from its current price levels before the end of 2025.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;My base-case expectation is for new all-time highs, hopefully over $100,000, so hopefully six figures. But then literally that range… that range is entirely reasonable. I’d actually be hesitant to guess where that ends up,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I think that something like $100,000 plus would be kind of disappointing for a bull market cycle, especially after the prior bull market cycle was on the disappointing end, too. So I’d kind of hope for $200,000 or more over the next two-plus years.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $45,200, down by almost 1% over the past day. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Analyst Expects Bitcoin to Hit $1 Million After ETF Approval</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3, believes Bitcoin has the potential to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-analyst-bitcoin-could-hit-1-million-in-days-to-weeks-after-spot-etf-approval.htm">skyrocket to $1 million</a> within a matter of days to weeks following the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He said the combination of limited Bitcoin supply on exchanges and a surge of institutional investment will drive the price to unprecedented levels in a remarkably short period of time.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“You’re hitting a very limited supply of Bitcoin on the exchanges and available for purchase with a torrent of money,&#8221; Mow stated. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“This is why you can go really high all at one time.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mow highlighted the inflow of institutional capital that is expected to accompany the approval of a spot ETF, stating that there will be a torrent of money seeking to purchase the limited available Bitcoin on exchanges. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The surge in demand, coupled with the scarcity of supply, could result in a rapid and substantial price increase.</span></p>

<div class="p-rich_text_section">

<h2>BTC Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As of January 3, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-spikes-up-1-6-larger-rally-incoming.htm">Bitcoin</a> (BTC/USD) stands at $45,325, exhibiting significant levels influencing its near-term direction. The pivot point remains at $44,500, with resistance points at $45,992, $47,150, and $48,195.</p>
<p>A breach beyond these levels could amplify Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish momentum. Conversely, support is found at $43,290, $41,645, and $40,520.</p>

</div>
<p>The RSI at 67 suggests bullishness but nears overbought conditions, hinting at possible market saturation and a corrective phase.</p>
<p>BTC&#8217;s recent formation of a Doji candle around $45,850 and its approach to the $44,200 Fibonacci level indicate potential bearish correction.</p>
<p>Investors should thus stay alert to evolving market conditions and the likelihood of short-term volatility.</p>

<p>Saylor revealed in MicroStrategy&#8217;s <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en/investor-relations/events-presentations/q3-2023-financial-results-webinar-recording">2023 third-quarter earnings call</a>, and as first disclosed in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1050446/000095017023057418/mstr-20230930.htm">10-Q filing</a>, his intention to sell up to 5,000 shares per trading day within a four-month window.</p>
<p>This selling strategy, bound by a minimum price condition, allows Saylor to divest up to 400,000 shares of his vested options. The stock option awards, which are set to expire on April 26, 2024, form a key part of Saylor&#8217;s planned transaction.</p>
<p>“I was granted a stock option in 2014 with respect to 400,000 shares, which is going to expire next April,” said Saylor in the call. “Exercising this option will allow me to address personal obligations as well as acquire additional Bitcoin to my personal account.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I continue to be optimistic about MicroStrategy&#8217;s prospects and should note that my equity stake in the company after these sales will remain very significant,&#8221; said Saylor.</p>
<h2>MicroStrategy&#8217;s Holding Exceeds $8 Billion</h2>

<p>For the first time in a decade, the number of installed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-the-united-states.htm">Bitcoin</a> ATMs worldwide fell in 2023.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/">data</a> from Coin ATM Radar, the number of installed Bitcoin ATMs in the world fell 11%, from 37,827 on January 1, 2023, to 33,622 on the same date in 2024.</p>
<p>In the US, which accounts for 82% of all Bitcoin ATMs in the world, the number was also down, falling from 32,672 to 27,621 over the course of 2023.</p>
<p>Judging from Coin ATM Radar&#8217;s data, it is the first time ever that the number of installed Bitcoin ATMs in the US declines from one year to the next.</p>

<h2>Positive trend outside the US</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Although US and global numbers were down for the year, the trend remained positive in several regions.</p>
<p>In the European Union (EU), the number of crypto ATMs at the beginning of 2024 stood at 1,548, exactly 10 more ATMs than the 1,538 machines that were installed at the beginning of 2023.</p>
<figure id="attachment_146746" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146746" style="width: 1370px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-146746" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704229663-eu-bitcoin-atms.png" alt="Bitcoin ATMs in the EU" width="1370" height="792" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704229663-eu-bitcoin-atms.png 1370w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704229663-eu-bitcoin-atms-300x173.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704229663-eu-bitcoin-atms-1024x592.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704229663-eu-bitcoin-atms-768x444.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704229663-eu-bitcoin-atms-150x87.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1370px) 100vw, 1370px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-146746" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Coin ATM Radar</figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, the number of Bitcoin ATMs was also up in Canada, Australia, Spain and Poland, while Switzerland saw a notable decrease in the number of installed machines.</p>
<p>Other regions have also seen increased adoption of Bitcoin with the help of Bitcoin ATMs, with for instance Bitcoin users in Argentina and El Salvador having access to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-atm-users-in-argentina-can-now-use-lightning-network.htm">Lightning Network-enabled Bitcoin ATMs</a>.</p>
<p>The all-time high in the worldwide number of Bitcoin ATMs was reached in August of 2022 with 39,376 installed machines, per Coin ATM Radar&#8217;s data.</p>
<h2>Who is the largest Bitcoin ATM operator and manufacturer?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
By far the largest operator of Bitcoin ATMs at the moment is Bitcoin Depot, an Atlanta-based publicly listed company in the US.</p>
<p>According to Coin ATM Radar, Bitcoin Depot operates 6,311 Bitcoin ATMs, well ahead of the 3,880 ATMs that are controlled by CoinFlip, the second-largest operator.</p>

<p>In terms of machine manufacturers, General Bytes leads the race with 10,844 machines, or a 32.3% market share, ahead of Genesis Coin with its 7,683 machines and 22.9% market share.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin (BTC/USD)</a> commences 2024 with an impressive 2.47% rise in value, reaching $44,907 on January 2, the cryptocurrency market watches closely.</p>
<p>This increase not only highlights a significant trading volume of over $39 billion within 24 hours but also cements Bitcoin&#8217;s dominant position with a nearing <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">$900 billion market cap</a>.</p>
<p>With approximately 19.6 million BTC in circulation, gradually approaching its 21 million cap, the key question arises: Can Bitcoin maintain this upward momentum in a market that is constantly evolving and increasingly competitive?</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the technical realm, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-spikes-up-1-6-larger-rally-incoming.htm">Bitcoin</a>’s current trajectory reveals critical price levels that could dictate its short-term movement. The pivot point for Bitcoin is established at $44,500, with key resistance levels identified at $45,992, $47,150, and $48,195.</p>
<p>Should Bitcoin manage to break through these barriers, it could signal a continuation or even an escalation of the current bullish trend.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support levels are placed at $43,290, $41,645, and $40,520, providing potential floors to cushion any downward trends.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</a> for BTC/USD is at 67, indicating a bullish sentiment but verging close to the overbought territory.</p>

<p>This suggests that Bitcoin might be approaching a saturation point in its current rally, potentially leading to a consolidation or correction phase.</p>
<p>Adding to this analysis is the observation of Bitcoin’s price in relation to its 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $43,290, affirming a short-term bullish trend.</p>
<p>However, recent chart patterns present a more nuanced picture. Bitcoin recently entered an overbought zone and formed a Doji candle near the $45,850 level, traditionally interpreted as a sign of indecision in the market.</p>
<p>This pattern could signal weakening upward momentum and raise the possibility of a bearish correction. Additionally, Bitcoin seems to be moving towards the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level around $44,200, further indicating potential downward pressure.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while the overall trend for Bitcoin appears to be bullish, particularly above the pivotal $45,250 mark, the near-term outlook is tinged with caution.</p>
<p>The approaching overbought conditions, combined with the recent <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doji.asp">Doji candle formation</a>, suggest that investors and traders should prepare for potential volatility and a possible bearish correction in the short term.</p>
<p>As always, in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, market dynamics can change rapidly, necessitating continuous monitoring of these technical indicators and patterns.</p>

<p>Former crypto-skeptic and “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer continued to sing Bitcoin’s praises during a Tuesday morning appearance on CNBC.                            </p>
<h2>Bitcoin is “here to stay”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“This thing &#8211; you can’t kill it,” Cramer stated while discussing news of Bitcoin reaching its highest trading price since April of 2022.</p>
<p>“Look, I mean, the reality is it&#8217;s a technological marvel and people have to start recognizing that it’s here to stay,” Cramer continued. “The SEC’s been against it the whole time.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, Bitcoin began trading above $45,000, a nearly 3.5% spike in the last 24 hours alone.</p>
<p>Cramer cited the impending approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF as a driving factor prompting bullish expectations of the token, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-reportedly-overwhelmed-with-paperwork-as-deadline-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approach.htm"> allegedly swamped with paperwork amidst a reported January 10th deadline.</a></p>
<h2>Could Bitcoin’s recent gains become unraveled?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The “Mad Money” host also referred to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-trial-recap-legal-analysis-and-whats-to-come.htm">the recent conviction of FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried</a> as an overall positive “clearing event” that stimulated the market.</p>
<p>However, Cramer also conceded the opposing view that Bitcoin’s gains could “all become unraveled.” </p>
<p>“Jamie Dimon has not spared any negative words,” CNBC anchor, David Faber, pointed out.</p>
<p>Most recently,<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-on-crypto-if-i-was-the-government-id-close-it-down.htm"> Dimon came under fire by the crypto community</a> for his December congressional testimony against the industry, stating that if he was in the U.S. government, he’d “close” the technology down.</p>
<p>“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” Dimon stated at the time. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, and tax avoidance.”</p>
<h2>“This is a remarkable comeback that was unexpected”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Previously, Cramer touted similar views to Dimon, claiming he “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqQiwbw9jQ8">would not touch crypto in a million years</a>” while referring to those who had invested in the technology as “an idiot.”</p>
<p>However, last month Cramer told “Mad Money” viewers to “buy Bitcoin” if they so choose, claiming he himself “made a lot of money” from his own investment despite being “premature” to the market.</p>
<p>Cramer’s latest appearance on CNBC seems to confirm the “Mad Money” host has changed his tune on the crypto industry itself.</p>
<p>“This is a remarkable comeback that was unexpected,” said Cramer.</p>
<p>A number of users on social media, however,<a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1742203998411608490"> remain less than convinced about the accuracy of Cramer’s sentiments</a> given his changing stance on the technology. </p>
<p>“Great, BTC going to zero,” one user commented on X,</p>
<p>“Well, pack it up boys,” another wrote. “It was a good run.”</p>

<p>Trillion-dollar asset managers are eyeing approval for their Bitcoin (BTC) ETF products within days, and all are competing to seize market share at the opening bell.</p>
<p>One major area of competition relates to management fees – the annual cost imposed by funds to handle the BTC backing their client’s shares. Though many have disclosed their planned fee structures in recent regulatory filings, the largest players within the race are curiously keeping their rates under wraps.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest unknowns left in this saga is what BlackRock&#8217;s fee will be on the bitcoin ETF,” <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1742172139304657054">wrote</a> Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas to X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Grayscale, he <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1742166022105227533">noted</a>, also left mention of a fee absent from its updated S-3 filing the same day. Until today, its massive Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) which boasts over 619,000 BTC ($26 billion) has charged a 2.00% fee on client assets, which investors starved of BTC-linked alternatives have frequently criticized as exploitative.</p>
<p>Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnhenshein has repeatedly promised to lower fees once conversion into an ETF is confirmed, but whether the fund can go lower than rivals remains a mystery. Last month, Ark Invest unveiled a management fee of 0.8% for its Bitcoin ETF, beating both Grayscale and the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which charges a 0.95% fee.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>How Low Can ETF Sponsors Go?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In its Friday S-1 update, Valkyrie <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1740837462245839276">unveiled</a> a matching 80 basis point fee. Fidelity, however, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1852317/000119312523306021/d375081ds1a.htm">revealed</a> an even lower 0.39% sponsor fee that same day, making it the lowest so far in the ETF race.</p>
<p>Galaxy and Invesco may have an even more enticing offer: though its standard sponsor fee is 0.59%, its latest filing <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1740863461784272960">promised</a> zero fees for its first six months of activity, as well as on its first $5 billion in assets.</p>
<p>The move will help entice initial capital from investors in what is largely viewed as a winner-take-all race to become the leading U.S. fund for gaining spot Bitcoin exposure. Unlike the first wave of Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021, experts expect this year’s many approvals to be simultaneous, creating more room for competition.</p>
<p>That just leaves <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-amid-42000-dip-blackrock-vaneck-etf-moves-jpmorgan-ceos-stance.htm">BlackRock</a> – the asset manager that inspired optimism for most applicants to try their hand upon filing with regulators for an ETF in June.</p>
<p>Balchunas predicted that the fund will target a 0.47% fee, which it could “get away” as long as it continues facing no competition from Vanguard.</p>
<p>“Undercutting Fidelity makes sense, could def happen, but they&#8217;ll also want to milk it because no Vanguard,” he added.</p>

<p>Surpassing the $45,000 mark means Bitcoin price has seen its highest level since April 2022 with brewing expectations for the pending approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.</p>
<p>Investor’s enthusiasm has intensified following a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-vaneck-among-asset-managers-that-submitted-updated-filings-spot-2023-12-30/">Reuters report</a> suggesting that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-submits-bitcoin-etf-filing-with-sec-to-adopt-cash-redemption-model.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>’s decision could come as soon as Tuesday, January 2.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, “the SEC may notify issuers as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday that they have been cleared to launch the following week,” said sources “who spoke on background given the confidential nature of the discussions.”</p>
<p>In addition to the record-breaking transaction count, the 24-hour trading volume has also surged by 85%, almost reaching the $30 billion mark.</p>
<h2><strong>Matrixport Forecasts BTC to Reach $50,000 on ETF Approval</strong></h2>

<p>In a remarkable shift, <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a> has surged to $45,316, marking a 7.06% increase on Tuesday. This breakthrough above $45K comes at a crucial time, just ahead of a potential ETF approval that could significantly impact its market trajectory.</p>
<p>Amidst these developments, ChatGPT sheds light on the role of artificial intelligence in forecasting Bitcoin&#8217;s ascent to a staggering $100,000 by 2024.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, political factors such as Donald Trump&#8217;s potential loss in the upcoming presidential election are speculated to trigger a stock market crash and possibly usher in a new Great Depression.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Breaks $45K Barrier Ahead of Anticipated ETF Approval</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin (BTC) has reached above $45,000 for the first time in over two years, and the price is expected to rise further with the upcoming approval of the first spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-surges-to-45000-pending-secs-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency&#8217;s value has now surpassed all 2023 highs, establishing a significant new yearly peak just two days into 2024, after rising more than 6% in the last 24 hours and 170% in the last year. The market is waiting for the SEC&#8217;s verdict on 14 pending applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s latest price spike has sparked controversy among market observers, as it was last seen above $45,000 nearly 20 months ago in April 2022.</p>
<p>While some anticipate a potential &#8220;bull pennant&#8221; formation leading to a $54,000 gain upon SEC approval, others, such as VanEck advisor Gabor Gurbacs, anticipate an initial drop but enormous trillions in inflows in the future years.</p>
<h2>ChatGPT Foresees AI&#8217;s Role in Bitcoin&#8217;s Potential Rise to $100K</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The latest incarnation of the AI chatbot, ChatGPT-4, suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s price might reach $100,000 in 2024 under certain favorable conditions, citing variables such as positive legislative developments, growing acceptance, and currency depreciation.</p>
<p>While it is considered highly speculative, ChatGPT shows the possible positive impact of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, which would increase accessibility and liquidity while potentially drawing institutional investors.</p>

<p>ChatGPT emphasizes AI&#8217;s involvement in market analysis, trading techniques, and larger blockchain tech improvements in response to how AI could contribute to this scenario.</p>
<p>AI algorithms, which are capable of digesting massive amounts of market data and spotting trends, can enable faster and more efficient trading execution, but they also warn of potential threats like as hacking and cyberattacks.</p>
<p>The findings of ChatGPT point to a possible uptick in Bitcoin values, owing to AI&#8217;s influence on market dynamics and trading techniques.</p>
<h2>Trump&#8217;s Election Loss Could Signal Stock Market Crash, Warns AI</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Former <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/111666136735962039">US President Donald Trump has offered a dire warning</a> about the American economy, forecasting a stock market crash worse than 1929 and a Great Depression if he does not win the presidential election.</p>
<p>Trump attacked the current state of the economy, crediting its survival to his administration&#8217;s accomplishments. He claimed that the stock market&#8217;s strong valuation is due to the expectation of his election victory in 2024.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The impact of Trump&#8217;s warnings on Bitcoin prices remains theoretical, but historical evidence suggests that his re-election could spark a positive response in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin expectations reaching all-time highs.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On January 2nd, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-spikes-up-1-6-larger-rally-incoming.htm">Bitcoin</a>, the pioneering cryptocurrency, displayed a significant upward trend, marking an impressive start to the new year. Trading around the $44,501 pivot point, Bitcoin shows potential for further gains, as indicated by key technical levels and market sentiment.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance levels for Bitcoin are set at $46,439, $48,195, and $49,857. These levels serve as potential targets for Bitcoin’s upward journey, suggesting room for growth if the bullish momentum continues. Conversely, support levels are identified at $43,096, $41,884, and $40,238, offering crucial thresholds that could protect Bitcoin from any significant price drops.</p>
<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<figure id="attachment_146463" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146463" style="width: 1731px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-146463" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704180920-image-35.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Chart - Source: Tradingview" width="1731" height="915" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704180920-image-35.png 1731w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704180920-image-35-300x159.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704180920-image-35-1024x541.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704180920-image-35-768x406.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704180920-image-35-1536x812.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704180920-image-35-150x79.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1731px) 100vw, 1731px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-146463" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price Chart &#8211; Source: Tradingview</figcaption></figure>
<p>The technical indicators present a compelling picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at a high 81, indicating overbought conditions. This level could suggest that Bitcoin might be nearing a short-term peak, with potential for a correction or consolidation in the near future. However, the RSI also reflects the strong buying interest and momentum that has characterized Bitcoin&#8217;s recent market movement.</p>
<p>Adding to this bullish narrative is the observation of the &#8216;Three White Soldiers&#8217; candlestick pattern, typically seen as a bullish signal. This pattern suggests a strong buying trend and could indicate that investors are confident about Bitcoin&#8217;s prospects. However, the overbought RSI warrants a cautious approach, as the market could be poised for a volatility swing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the technical analysis points to a bullish trend for Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency aiming to test and potentially breach higher resistance levels.</p>

<p>Matrixport has predicted that the price of Bitcoin will jump to $50,000 this month based on several factors in a report released today.</p>
<p>According to Matrixport, this bullish trend is attributed to various factors, including the potential approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF, institutional buying momentum, and historical trends.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.matrixport.com/institutions/research/daily-insights/811">Matrixport&#8217;s analysis</a> indicates that after a customary mid-to-end December consolidation, Bitcoin is positioned for a robust breakout at the onset of the new year, driven by an anticipated influx of institutional investors eager to capitalize on potential rallies.</p>
<p>The report suggests that the importance of institutional investors not wanting to miss out on potential market upswings will lead to a swift and immediate buying flow when trading resumes in 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-surges-to-45000-pending-secs-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">Bitcoin surged past $45,000</a> mark today for the first time since April 2022. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is hovering around $45,200, with a 7% rise in the last 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Of particular note is the speculation surrounding the impending <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-btc-etf-approval-will-encourage-more-institutions-to-invest-in-bitcoin-cathie-wood.htm">approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF</a> by the US SEC, with Matrixport suggesting that the announcement could be made this week.</p>
<p>Matrixport dismisses the notion of a &#8216;sell-the-news&#8217; event, contending that approval would legitimize Bitcoin as a valuable asset class for institutional portfolios.</p>
<p>The report also highlights the potential risk on the upside, emphasizing the scarcity of available Bitcoin on exchanges, as many holders have adopted cold-storage options.</p>
<p>Matrixport estimates that up to $10 billion in fiat money may struggle to find sufficient Bitcoin on exchanges for ETF exposure, potentially contributing to a supply shortage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Matrixport factors in the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle expected in April 2024, along with historical trends suggesting robust performance during election years.</p>
