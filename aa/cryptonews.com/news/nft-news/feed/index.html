<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sales of NFTs on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> network reached a new milestone in December 2023, surpassing $881 million for the first time ever. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/blockchains/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">data by CryptoSlam</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, NFT sales on the Bitcoin chain reached $881,223,753.92 last month, setting the highest single-month sales record to date.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This included 111,713 buyer addresses and 98,744 seller addresses, both setting the highest single-month records to date. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin NFTs, also known as Ordinals, are a new type of NFT that exists on the Bitcoin blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unlike traditional NFTs which are mostly associated with the Ethereum blockchain, Bitcoin NFTs are unique in that they are inscribed directly onto individual satoshis, the smallest unit of a bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More specifically, each Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million satoshis. Bitcoin NFTs are created by inscribing data onto these satoshis. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This process is akin to engraving a tiny piece of data onto a small fraction of a Bitcoin.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum and Solana Trail Behind</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, trailed behind with NFT sales totaling $364.79 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BTC-focused NFT sales outperformed ETH&#8217;s by a significant margin, being 2.34 times greater in December. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solana secured the third spot with approximately $325.14 million in NFT sales, experiencing a remarkable 312% increase from the previous month.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Following the top three, Polygon and Arbitrum emerged as the subsequent leading blockchains in terms of NFT sales.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notable NFT Sales of December</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The pinnacle of December&#8217;s NFT transactions featured the sale of a digital copy of Vincent Van Gogh&#8217;s renowned Self-portrait, 1888 (Van Gogh&#8217;s painting #216), which commanded an impressive price of $1.19 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another notable sale took place on Ethereum, with the Frxethredemption Ticket #33 fetching $638,433 this month.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite a recent decline in NFT sales, dropping over 35% from the previous week, December witnessed a record-breaking $1.7 billion in NFT transactions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This marked a significant increase of more than 69% compared to November&#8217;s figures, with Bitcoin continuing to dominate NFT sales across various blockchains. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BTC-based NFT sales soared 127.63% above the chain&#8217;s November totals, as reported by cryptoslam.io statistics.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other notable high-value NFT sales in December include Cardano&#8217;s Deep Vision #05128, which fetched an impressive $551,750, and BNB&#8217;s Lockdealnft #91, garnering $329,824. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solana&#8217;s Boogle #009 completed the list of December&#8217;s five most expensive NFTs, selling for $274,209.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Out of the top ten NFT collections in terms of sales, seven were derived from the Bitcoin blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solana&#8217;s Tensorians secured the fifth position, while the Mad Lads collection held the eighth spot. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Arbitrum&#8217;s Sentry Node collection claimed the ninth position in December. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Throughout the month, a total of 11,290,812 NFT transactions took place, involving 469,389 sellers and 600,744 NFT buyers.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nfts-on-the-rise-again-october-saw-32-growth-in-trading-volume-trend-to-continue-this-month.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, prior to December, NFT trading volume surged by $99 million, reaching $405 million in October, signifying levels of sales not seen since August.</span></p>

<p>Sotheby&#8217;s, the renowned auction house with a rich history spanning 279 years, has made a significant impact on the digital art market in the current year. Fine arts auction house Sotheby&#8217;s reported making &#8220;close to $35 million&#8221; in digital art sales in 2023, marking it as a standout year for the emerging sector.</p>
<p>On December 23, Michael Bouhanna, the company&#8217;s Vice President and Head of Digital Art, <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelbouhanna/status/1738580008182923542">concluded</a> Sotheby&#8217;s year results regarding digital art on X as &#8220;one of the most exciting years for digital art.&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash; Michael Bouhanna (@michaelbouhanna) <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelbouhanna/status/1738580008182923542?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Notably, Sotheby&#8217;s conducted its first live digital art auction with 300 attendees, generating $12 million in sales. The auction house also set a new record for an individual digital artwork by selling Dmitry Chernyak&#8217;s non-fungible token (NFT) &#8216;Ringers #879&#8217; for an impressive $6.2 million.</p>
<p>In total, Sotheby&#8217;s conducted over 25 auctions focused exclusively on digital art or including it in contemporary art sales. The company launched its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/art-auction-giant-sothebys-unveils-on-chain-nft-secondary-marketplace.htm">on-chain marketplace for the secondary trade of NFTs</a> called Sotheby&#8217;s Metaverse.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sotheby&#8217;s partnered with 99-year-old artist Vera Molnar and Martin Grasser to launch the highly successful NFT collection &#8220;Themes and Variations.&#8221; This collaboration bridged the gap between generations and artistic mediums, proving that digital art can resonate with everyone.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Sotheby&#8217;s made history by auctioning the manuscript of Neal Stephenson&#8217;s cult novel &#8220;Avalanche,&#8221; believed to contain the first-ever use of the term &#8220;metaverse.&#8221; Looking ahead, Sotheby plans to refine its strategies in the primary market and continue supporting creators.</p>
<h2><b>Sotheby&#8217;s Enters NFT Space with Bitcoin Ordinals Collection, Reflecting Rising Interest in Digital Art Market</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The 279-year-old auction house entered the NFT space in April 2021 and has since conducted numerous record-breaking digital art sales.</p>
<p>The resurgence of the NFT space, coupled with a recent Bitcoin bull run, has contributed to increased interest and trade volumes in the digital art market.</p>
<p>The overall trade volume approached $1 billion in November, and the average NFT transaction value witnessed a 114% increase. Trading volume surged by 125% in November, suggesting a shift in user behavior compared to earlier downturns in NFT trading. This upward trend suggests a growing willingness among users to engage in higher-value trades.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that investments in crypto assets like NFTs are unregulated and may not be suitable for all investors. Such investments carry the risk of complete loss and are not targeted at or accessible to investors in Spain.</p>
<p>On December 7, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sothebys-launches-first-bitcoin-ordinals-based-nft-auction.htm">Sotheby&#8217;s announced</a> that it would sell a Bitcoin Ordinals collection for the 279-year-old auction house.</p>
<p>Sotheby&#8217;s said the sale of pieces from BitcoinShrooms, an ordinals project by pseudonymous artist Shroomtoshi, is the first time works from the collection will be made available to the public.</p>
<p>The collection consists of a series of pixel art pieces that reference Bitcoin&#8217;s history and underlying principles, including memes and technical concepts.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s <strong>Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</strong> has published <a href="https://www.miit.gov.cn/zwgk/jytafwgk/art/2023/art_7eba1016ef5a4d98979b0167f38e4b35.html">a document</a> outlining its current and future work on developing Web3 and related technologies, including metaverse, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized apps (dapps).</p>
<p>The document is a response to a proposal by Wu Jiezhuang, a member of the <strong>National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference</strong>.</p>
<p>The Ministry examined Wu&#8217;s &#8216;Proposal on Promoting the Development of Web3 Industry,&#8217; along with the <strong>Chinese Academy of Sciences</strong> and the <strong>China Association for Science and Technology</strong>.</p>
<p>They concluded that Wu&#8217;s suggestions align with the Ministry&#8217;s direction, as the latter &#8220;attaches great importance&#8221; to the Web3 industry development.</p>
<p>According to the response,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Your suggestions on strengthening resource support for Web3.0 technology research and development, strengthening technical supervision and management, encouraging international cooperation, and strengthening publicity and promotion are forward-looking and strategic, and are highly consistent with the key tasks of our ministry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In particular, the Ministry acknowledged China&#8217;s advantages in developing Web3, including proper industrial foundation and broad development space.</p>
<h2>Fostering NFTs and Metaverse</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The response outlined several steps the country has already taken to support the industry. Notably, this comes despite the 2021 blanket <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-court-classifies-digital-assets-as-property-despite-blanket-ban-by-government.htm">crypto ban</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Ministry and the <strong>Cyberspace Administration of China</strong> have issued a series of policies, including the Guiding Opinions on Accelerating the Application of Blockchain Technology and Industrial Development.</p>
<p>Also, the <strong>National Standardization Committee</strong> worked with the Ministry to establish the <strong>National Blockchain and Distributed Accounting Technology Standardization Technical Committee</strong> to provide an environment for blockchain-based Web3 development.</p>
<p>Next, research institutions continue to explore Web3-related technologies. This includes <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/reeboks-blockchain-powered-gaming-experience-set-to-transform-fashion.htm">metaverse</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/super-mario-inspired-nft-fetches-over-240k-at-sothebys-auction.htm">NFT</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Ministry supports the establishment of several data institutions, such as the <strong>Beijing International Big Data Exchange</strong> and the <strong>Shanghai Data Exchange</strong>. These provide a &#8220;testing ground&#8221; for applications.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Cyberspace Administration of China, together with the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, the Supreme People&#8217;s Court, and other departments, organized and carried out national blockchain innovative application pilot actions, forming typical cases and experiences that can be replicated and promoted in 16 fields such as energy, law, copyright, and finance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, the country has established working groups with international organizations to collaborate on developing international and domestic standards.</p>
<h2>Four Future Steps</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In response to Wu&#8217;s suggestions, the Ministry said it would strengthen collaborations with relevant departments to promote Web3 innovation and &#8220;high-quality industrial development.&#8221;</p>
<p>It outlined its four steps in that direction.</p>
<p>First: improve the research of Web3, formulate a development strategy, and clarify the application model.</p>

<p>Major auction house <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/art-auction-giant-sothebys-unveils-on-chain-nft-secondary-marketplace.htm"><strong>Sotheby&#8217;s</strong></a> first inscription auction has been a success, closing with nearly $451,000 raised.</p>
<p>Between December 6 and 13, Sotheby’s New York held an online sale of select <strong>BitcoinShrooms</strong> from the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-bounces-back-above-43000-after-strong-us-retail-sales-data-prompts-brief-price-dip-heres-why-btc-could-soon-hit-fresh-yearly-highs.htm">Bitcoin</a> ordinals project by Shroomtoshi.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/digital-catalogues/bitcoinshrooms-an-ordinals-auction">Per</a> the company&#8217;s website,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Elegantly weaving the nuanced tapestry of Bitcoin’s history, culture, and core technicalities, each unique, pixelated, and hand-crafted piece forms part of a masterful, yet playful guide to the revolutionary realm of Bitcoin.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The auction featured three images from the unreleased pixilated collection, seemingly inspired by <strong>Super Mario</strong>. These include the S shroom (the “S” stands for Self-Sovereignty), the Sovereign Individual, and the BIP39 seed from which all &#8220;Bitcoin addresses and their corresponding private keys are ultimately derived.&#8221;</p>
<p>The initial <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2023/bitcoinshrooms-an-ordinals-auction?locale=en">estimate</a> for each of the three pieces was $20,000-30,000.</p>
<p>As the auction closed, the results were in:</p>
<ul>
<li>the S shroom sold for $241,300;</li>
<li>the Sovereign Individual sold for $107,950;</li>
<li>the BIP39 seed sold for $101,600.</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, the price for the three was $450,850. This is five times more than the highest total estimated price of $90,000.</p>
<h2>Pixelated Recap of Bitcoin&#8217;s 13 Years</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/international-womens-day-sothebys-auction-house-unicorndao-hold-art-auction-benefitting-womens-rights.htm">Sotheby&#8217;s</a> describes Shroomtoshi as a technically inclined digital artist and a trailblazer in &#8220;the booming Ordinal ecosystem&#8221; with an encyclopedic knowledge of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The artist commented that,</p>
<p>&#8220;The BitcoinShrooms collection is a pixelated recap of the first 13 years of Bitcoin, a homage to the 8-bit style of art that expresses a slight nostalgia for the 90s, a way to soil 10s of thousands of SSDs spread across the world with my art (-&gt;next level cyber-vandalism), a tool to raise awareness about Bitcoin and what I personally view as its core principles, an ironic way to vent at what I see as its annoying pop elements and aberrations. it is a thank you to those I worked with and learned from, to those who are not around anymore but whose name should not be forgotten. it is knowledge condensed and a journey for the curious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ordinals are the non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cheating-rampant-in-blockchain-chess-leading-to-shutdown-of-immortal-games-play-to-earn-features.htm">NFTs</a>) of the Bitcoin ledger.</p>
<p>The auction house noted that &#8216;inscriptions&#8217; and &#8216;ordinals,&#8217; though often used interchangeably, have different meanings. An ordinal is the asset &#8211; the unique, serialized satoshi that its owner may transfer. An inscription is the encoded media content that is embedded within the ordinal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sotheby&#8217;s is not new to the NFT realm.</p>
<p>The auction house sold digital collectibles owned by the bankrupt Singaporean crypto hedge fund  <strong>Three Arrows Capital</strong> (3AC) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-artwork-seized-from-three-arrows-capital-fetches-109-million-sothebys-auction.htm">for a total of $10.9 million</a> in June.</p>
<p>In May, Sotheby’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/art-auction-giant-sothebys-unveils-on-chain-nft-secondary-marketplace.htm">launched</a> an NFT secondary marketplace. It allows users to buy curated NFTs on the <strong>Ethereum</strong> and <strong>Polygon</strong> networks.</p>

<p>The former U.S. President Donald Trump has introduced his latest <a href="https://collecttrumpcards.com/">“MugShot”</a> edition <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fifa-enters-nft-arena-offering-fans-digital-collectibles-and-world-cup-tickets.htm">NFT</a> collection, referring to his previous arrest.</p>
<p>Priced at $99 per digital trading card, the “MugShot” edition not only encapsulates Trump&#8217;s legal history but also adds a new dimension to his previous digital collectible endeavors. Buyers who purchase 47 or more of these cards, a nod to Trump&#8217;s potential return as the 47th U.S. president, will be granted an exclusive dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and a piece of the suit he wore during his arrest in August.</p>
<h2>The &#8220;MugShot&#8221; Edition Trading Cards</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This new release of “MugShot” has also stirred interest in the digital collectibles market, rekindling interest in Trump&#8217;s earlier NFTs, leading to a significant rebound in their market value.</p>
<p>“Just Like Baseball Cards, But You Collect Them Digitally!” wrote the Trump NFT website. “In this Edition, some cards will even be one-of-ones (the only one in the world), while some others could even be hand-signed by President Donald J. Trump.”</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In addition to the dinner with the former president, the consumers who purchase 47 cards in a single transaction would receive a physical card with a piece of cloth from the suit which Trump wore getting arrested, the same one in his mugshot.</p>
<h2>Presidential Candidate Says Trump Don’t “Understand” Crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On Dec. 12, Representative Dean Phillips <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/democratic-presidential-candidate-dean-phillips-says-biden-and-trump-dont-understand-crypto.htm">openly criticized</a> both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump for their limited understanding of cryptocurrencies during the Crypto Presidential Forum.</p>
<p>As a Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election, Phillips acknowledged his own gaps in knowledge about financial technology and digital assets, but pointed out the scarcity of expertise in Congress regarding these topics. He specifically highlighted the lack of comprehension from both current and former presidents, stressing the need for more informed leadership in the evolving digital asset landscape.</p>
<p>“The two leading candidates right now, on both the left and the right, for the U.S. presidency are absolutely not in positions to understand it, prepare us for it, anticipate it, and lead us into the next century,” said Phillips. “Joe Biden and Donald Trump, at their age and stage of life, are simply not the right people to lead us forward.”</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-us-president-donald-trump-holds-around-500000-digital-assets.htm">financial filing</a> in August, Trump holds between $250,000 to $500,000 in digital assets. He <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/donald-trump-99-nfts-sbf-arrest-crypto-week-in-review.htm">released</a> the $99 trading cards in December 2022.</p>

<p><strong>FIFA</strong>, the famous international governing body for football, has announced a new digital collectible collection in its first collaboration with tech firm <strong>Modex</strong> &#8211; with some notable perks.</p>
<p>&#8216;FIFA+ Collect&#8217; will be dropping the &#8220;dual digital collectible&#8221; for the FIFA Club World Cup Saudi Arabia 2023, the press release <a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/tournaments/mens/fifa-club-world-cup/saudi-arabia-2023/articles/plus-collect-new-collection-collaboration-modex">said</a>.</p>
<p>The first drop of 100 digital collectibles will be available on December 15. It will feature &#8220;the rarest collectibles that offer the chance to secure FIFA World Cup 26 final tickets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Modex CEO Francesco Abbate commented that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The FIFA Club World Cup promises to be an exciting 10 days and with the release of collectibles that can secure actual FIFA match items and FIFA World Cup 26 final access, there’s an added incentive for fans to participate.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>More collectibles will launch on the FIFA+ Collect platform during the FIFA Club World Cup, which begins today in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. They will showcase major moments from the tournament.</p>
<p>Notably, FIFA initially used <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-protocol-algorand-forms-strategic-collaborations-in-india-for-web3-push.htm"><strong>Algorand</strong></a> as the official blockchain platform. However, this time, it will use the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polygon-pos-now-supported-by-amazon-managed-blockchain-access.htm">Polygon</a> network to mint its non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pudgy-penguins-unveils-web3-game-pudgy-world-powered-by-zksync-era.htm">NFTs</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>FIFA said that a total of 900 digital collectibles would be issued on Polygon on December 19. The NFTs will also be available on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-marketplace-opensea-to-reduce-workforce-as-it-is-planning-big-changes.htm"><strong>OpenSea</strong></a> marketplace.</p>
<h2>More to Come</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
FIFA Chief Business Officer Romy Gai said that since its launch, FIFA+ Collect has been &#8220;immensely&#8221; popular globally. Fans worldwide have been given the opportunity &#8220;to own a piece of football history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gai further indicated that the association has plans for future digital collectibles.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These new launches, both this year and beyond, will provide football fans with a unique and innovative way to connect with the sport, while also contributing to the growth of the digital collectibles market.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://collect.fifa.com/faqs">Per</a> the FAQ page, FIFA has noticed that the football fandom is changing. Fans are now seeking to engage with the most popular game in the world in &#8220;new and exciting ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Therefore, the association created the platform to make FIFA digital collectibles available to all football fans, it said. With it, the organization argued, it is providing an &#8220;accessible opportunity&#8221; for fans to engage with the game and &#8220;democratising the ability&#8221; to own a part of the World Cup.</p>
<p>As for the platform, FIFA+ Collect is described as an affordable and inclusive marketplace for digital collectibles. While there is currently no secondary marketplace, &#8220;it will be opening soon,&#8221; the FAQ said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, besides FIFA World Cup, FIFA+ Collect offers digital collectibles featuring memorable moments in <a href="https://collect.fifa.com/drops">FIFA Women’s World Cup</a> history.</p>
<p>Previously, FIFA <a href="https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022/media-releases/crypto-com-unveiled-as-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-tm-official-sponsor">announced</a> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/okx-and-bybit-capitalize-as-binances-market-share-declines-more-news.htm"><strong>Crypto.com</strong></a> as the exclusive cryptocurrency trading platform sponsor of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022.</p>

<p>Popular NFT project <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/adorable-penguins-are-taking-over-the-nft-scene-11427.htm"><strong>Pudgy Penguins</strong></a> has revealed the upcoming alpha launch of <strong>Pudgy World</strong> &#8211; a Web3 game based on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-eth-rises-above-2300-can-eth-reach-3500-by-december-31.htm"><strong>Ethereum</strong></a> Layer 2 network <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-ankr-and-matter-labs-launch-zksync-era-nodes-hyperchain-on-microsoft-azure-marketplace-societe-generale-forge-gets-first-french-crypto-licence-bitdeer-sits-in-2nd-highest-place-in-va.htm"><strong>zkSync Era</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pudgy-penguins-announces-pudgy-world-alpha-powered-by-zksync-at-art-basel-miami-302010721.html">According</a> to the press release, the alpha will launch in Q1 of 2024. With it, Pudgy Penguins moves beyond non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/reeboks-blockchain-powered-gaming-experience-set-to-transform-fashion.htm">NFT</a>) collectibles to &#8220;a fully immersive entertainment and lifestyle brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Players will be able to explore an open world and customize their unique penguin characters. They will participate in story-driven journeys and interact with each other.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Pudgy World vision is simple. Build an open-world storytelling experience that is fun, playable by millions, and on-chain.</p>
<p>Here is a sneak peak of what’s to come: <a href="https://t.co/5FhhucJUxP">pic.twitter.com/5FhhucJUxP</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Pudgy Penguins (@pudgypenguins) <a href="https://twitter.com/pudgypenguins/status/1733672588134514867?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Project Penguins went on to announce several firsts. It said that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The launch of Pudgy World plunges the company into Web3 gaming as the first-ever Web3 game with digital and physical collectibles.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the team introduced two characters as Pudgy Penguins&#8217; first &#8220;Hero Characters.&#8221; Pudgy and Peaches will guide the players and drive the game&#8217;s narrative.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In 2024, licensing Penguins from our community and featuring community-owned<br />Penguins in products, animations, story, and more will ramp up with the launch of our IP licensing marketplace <a href="https://twitter.com/OverpassIP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OverpassIP</a>. <a href="https://t.co/SetV0XSWaV">pic.twitter.com/SetV0XSWaV</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Pudgy Penguins (@pudgypenguins) <a href="https://twitter.com/pudgypenguins/status/1733672681738818009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Finally, the alpha will be a first-of-its-kind fusion of entertainment IP and zero-knowledge (ZK) blockchain technology, it said. This is &#8220;a vital step towards mass adoption of Web3 technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>To make the game a success, the team needed the right blockchain. It had to be reliable, easy to access, and built to scale.</p>
<p>SVP of Growth at <strong>Matter Labs</strong> Michael Lee commented that Pudgy World leverages zkSync&#8217;s ZK technology to &#8220;unlock new business models and gaming experiences, similar to the gaming industry&#8217;s transformative shift to mobile games.&#8221;</p>
<h2>No Prior Pudgy Penguin Ownership Needed</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The team describes the new game as &#8220;an immersive, digital environment&#8221; available to Pudgy Penguins NFT holders, Pudgy Toy owners, and all &#8220;adventurous gamers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Per the announcement, players will not need to hold an NFT nor buy a toy to play the alpha version of Pudgy World.</p>
<p>However, holders may get certain benefits.</p>
<p>Each Pudgy Penguin toy comes with a QR code. Once scanned, it will allow the owner to claim unique traits for their digital Forever Pudgy Penguin character inside the game.</p>
<p>All toys are connected to existing pieces of NFT IP, so the current NFT holders will receive licensing royalties for each corresponding toy.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">For our Pudgy Toy experience, you scan the included QR code, make an account, redeem your traits, and customize your Forever Pudgy Penguin.</p>
<p>In Q1 of 2024, this experience gets elevated with our Pudgy World Alpha launch, merging our physical and digital worlds into one. <a href="https://t.co/6GIpe8BwfQ">pic.twitter.com/6GIpe8BwfQ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Pudgy Penguins (@pudgypenguins) <a href="https://twitter.com/pudgypenguins/status/1733672602571268593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz said that, with owners playing with their Pudgy Toys, they will not need to have any knowledge of the blockchain technology the game is built on. This, he said, makes the Pudgy World alpha launch &#8220;a massive step forward&#8221; for the Web3 and NFT space.</p>
<p>There will be no trading between users at launch. Players can only get returns from the original sale. However, when Pudgy World &#8220;exits a later phase,&#8221; players will be able to participate in the Pudgy World game economy, it said.</p>
<p>According to Michael Lee,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The launch of Pudgy World, in collaboration with Walmart, stands as a remarkable testament to the capabilities of our joint development teams. Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned NFT collector or venturing into crypto for the first time, Pudgy World aims to welcome millions of gamers into web3 to have fun, as well as forge lasting friendships.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In September, Pudgy Penguins launched its toy line in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pudgy-penguins-nft-launches-toys-2000-walmart-stores-trading-volume-surges-by-530.htm">over 2,000 <strong>Walmart</strong> stores</a> across the US.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/more-major-south-korean-exchanges-begin-listing-usdt.htm">South Korean</a> financial regulators have said <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-make-an-nft-for-free-sell-it.htm">NFTs</a> are not subject to the same rules as cryptoassets, a ruling that may buoy token issuers and blockchain gaming firms.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/5256157" target="_blank" rel="noopener">News1</a>, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the nation’s top regulator, stated that “following CBDCs,” NFTs will also be “excluded from” its “lists of virtual assets.”</p>
<p>The FSC has previously created separate regulations for CBDCs. Lawmakers have also <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/s-korean-mps-create-law-that-distinguishes-cbdcs-from-crypto-digital-krw-launch-imminent.htm">created legislation that distinguishes digital fiat from tokens</a> like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>.</p>
<p>The Virtual Asset User Protection Act defines cryptoassets as “electronic tokens that have economic value and can be traded or transferred electronically.”</p>
<p>Some claimed that this phrasing does not make it clear if NFTs can legally be considered as cryptoassets.</p>
<p>In the past, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-gaming-watchdog-wont-budge-on-tough-anti-nft-stance.htm">gaming regulators refused to issue licenses to video games that make use of NFTs.</a></p>
<p>Critics claim this has effectively blocked the progress of blockchain gaming in the nation.</p>
<p>However, the FSC claimed that as NFTs are “unique and irreplaceable,” they pose a “limited” risk to the financial system.</p>
<p>The regulator ruled that most NFTS are “mainly traded for collection purposes,” as opposed to crypto – which it feels is mainly used as a speculative tool.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1f0-1f1f7.png" alt="🇰🇷" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> South Korea’s Biggest Supermarket Says Next-gen ATMs May Be Crypto Compatible</p>
<p>Emart, South Korea’s largest retailer and supermarket chain, says its new next-generation ATMs could offer trading functions with crypto and security tokens.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoNews</a><a href="https://t.co/Sf0TlCjtnm">https://t.co/Sf0TlCjtnm</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>NFTs Not Subject to South Korean Crypto Law – But There Are Exceptions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite the statement, not all NFT issuers will be covered by the new ruling. The regulator added several caveats to its ruling.</p>
<p>It explained that some NFTs could still be considered to be “virtual assets” in certain conditions.</p>
<p>Namely, these include NFTs that are “issued in large quantities like typical virtual assets and traded in a fungible manner.”</p>
<p>NFTs that can “be used as a means of payment for specific goods or services” will also be classified as cryptoassets.</p>
<p>Additionally, the FSC has also ruled that banks that hold crypto exchange users’ fiat must pay interest on deposits.</p>
<p>Previously, the Virtual Asset User Protection Act required virtual asset business operators to separate users’ deposits from their own assets and use custodial services.</p>
<p>But the new decree requires exchanges to use banks as custodians. And it dictates that banks must pay interest on fiat holdings.</p>
<p>The FSC further told crypto business operators they “must store more than 80% of their assets in cold wallets.”</p>

<p>Yesterday, legendary American thrash metal band Megadeth announced the launch of a new non-fungible token (NFT) collection, offering fans exclusive access to digital and real-world experiences.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Megadeth/status/1732059313504415762">The band unveiled the news via a post on X</a>, stating that the collection will consist of 5,000 NFTs featuring their mascot, Vic Rattlehead. Owning one of these NFTs will provide access to experiences like private conversations with band members in the metaverse. Megadeth also noted that they hope to foster a community owned by fans rather than a standard fan club with this initiative.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Warm Reception From Megadeth&#8217;s Online Following</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since the announcement, Megadeth has received an <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePhenomenalAV/status/1732059686273265904">outpouring of enthusiasm</a> from its substantial social media following. Many fans responded to the band&#8217;s post positively about the fusion of heavy metal and NFTs.</p>
<p>Other artists in the industry have also voiced support. M. Shadows, lead singer of Avenged Sevenfold, congratulated Megadeth on the launch.</p>
<p><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">&#8220;Congrats to </span><span class="r-18u37iz"><a class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1loqt21" dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/MegadethDigital">@MegadethDigital</a> </span>Every project should be judged on the merit of what they provide and not the underpinning technology,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/shadows_eth/status/1732080721337196613">he tweeted</a>. &#8220;Blockchain simply gives you more options and ownership. Hope to see more artists take the leap with their communities.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Megadeth&#8217;s NFT Collection Follows Broader Music Industry Shift</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The release comes on the heels of several other musicians exploring web3. Since May 2023, <a href="https://www.avengedsevenfold.com/news/avenged-sevenfold-heavy-metal-approach-token-gated-ticketing-">Avenged Sevenfold has been providing fans access</a> to upcoming tour tickets through NFTs.</p>
<p>Additionally, on the same day as Megadeth&#8217;s announcement, the blockchain-based music platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-jackson-s-first-ever-studio-demo-to-be-released-on-blockchain">anotherblock revealed plans</a> to drop an unreleased Michael Jackson demo on December 7.</p>
<p>The ongoing wave of experimentation indicates that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/art-auction-giant-sothebys-unveils-on-chain-nft-secondary-marketplace.htm">major artists</a> are attracted to the prospect of using web3 to provide fans with new avenues of access, engagement, and ownership.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/nft/">NFTs</a> may be taking a backseat to AI currently, the technology remains appealing for its ability to cultivate direct artist-fan connections. With their deep fanbase and metal ethos, Megadeth is well-positioned to creatively deploy NFTs. Their Vic Rattlehead collection marks the latest attempt by a storied music act to explore the possibilities of web3.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/final-fantasy-publisher-square-enix-reveals-how-to-obtain-nfts-for-upcoming-game-symbiogenesis.htm"><strong>Square Enix</strong></a> has sold all character non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nike-rtfkt-nft-collections-generate-1-4-billion-in-trading-volume.htm">NFTs</a>) in the first auction for its upcoming game <strong>Symbiogenesis</strong>.</p>
<p>Square Enix is the publisher of titles such as <strong>Final Fantasy</strong>, <strong>Kingdom Hearts</strong>, and <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>. The company&#8217;s new projects are bound to draw major attention.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, the company decided to hold the auction in three phases between November 27 and December 3.</p>
<p>Notably, there was no public mint. Users had to join the Allow List Entry Campaign to mint NFT Characters.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s reasonable to suggest that this has contributed to the exclusivity aspect of the game.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Phases 1 and 2 allowed users to bid only on one character. This means that more sought-after characters will see their prices rise swiftly.</p>
<p>And those who were outbid were allowed to move on to raise bids on a different character.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://twitter.com/symbiogenesisPR/status/1730786393931337950">additional perks</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/symbiogenesisPR/status/1729810208795557898">rewards</a> for top players were available along the way. Though not everybody enjoyed these, <a href="https://twitter.com/gh_rocks/status/1730862049511559284">describing</a> them as &#8216;overcomplicating things.&#8217;</p>
<p>The mint price for all phases started at 0 ETH. Bidding could be made in 0.01 ETH increments.</p>
<p>Winners will use these NFTs to log into the game, which is scheduled for launch on December 21.</p>
<h2>Sold Out</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Square Enix launched only 500 NFTs for Chapter 1 of the game. Ten were allocated for the first phase, 90 for the second, and 400 for the third.</p>
<p>On November 4, the team announced that &#8220;all 500 characters from Chapter 1 were minted.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_139363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139363" style="width: 651px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://twitter.com/symbiogenesisPR/status/1731496147804664028"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-139363" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701775343-screenshot-2023-12-05-121358.png" alt="" width="651" height="383" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701775343-screenshot-2023-12-05-121358.png 651w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701775343-screenshot-2023-12-05-121358-300x176.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1701775343-screenshot-2023-12-05-121358-150x88.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-139363" class="wp-caption-text">Source: symbiogenesisPR / Twitter</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some characters sold for over 1 ETH (currently $2,203). For example, Calyx <a href="https://symbiogenesis.app/">went for</a> 1 ETH, Newt for 1.3 ETH, and Wart for 1.6 ETH.</p>
<p>Murasaki was purchased for 2 ETH and Mistletoe for 2.06 ETH.</p>
<p>An additional selling factor is the combination of characters, story, and worldbuilding.</p>
<p>In this game, humanity has managed to survive the pollution by living on the Floating Continent. However, a Dragon attack puts everything in danger.</p>
<p>The World Mission is the last of the game. This story has multiple endings and will change depending on this mission.</p>
<p>Only three people who completed all the missions and collected special items will be able to participate in the World Mission.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s in a name?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Another potential price contributor may be the quirky side of the NFTs &#8211; specifically, names.</p>
<p>The Protagonist&#8217;s name is Chroma (<a href="https://symbiogenesis.app/">not for sale</a>).</p>
<p>There is a character called Fungus, for example. He was sold for just above 1 ETH. Another is Warehouse, sold for 1.4 ETH.</p>
<p>Other characters have names like Lumber, Timber, Chamomile, Arm, Navigation, Kind, Lovesickness, Handshake, Cactus, Protein, Tattoo&#8230;</p>
<p>This looks like a string of random words. They don&#8217;t even seem connected to the character&#8217;s appearance. It remains to be seen how, if at all, the names reflect characters.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy, on the other hand, features Cloud Strife, Sepiroth, and Yuna.</p>
<p>While Final Fantasy has Noctis Lucis Caelum, Symbiogenesis has Instruction. While the former has Vincent Valentine, the latter has Beverage.</p>
<p>Some may find this naming witty, others nonsensical.</p>
<p>Either way, perhaps it is due to the combination of the above-mentioned factors, in addition to notable character designs and naming choices, that the gamers are willing to splurge on these NFTs.</p>

<p>While the broader crypto market appears to be moving toward a potential bull-market phase, the non-fungible token (NFT) sector, led by collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes, is experiencing a contrasting trend.</p>
<p>The Nansen NFT-500 index, which gauges the valuation of the top 500 NFTs, has seen a 50% decline year-to-date when measured in Ether (ETH) and a 16% drop in US dollar terms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Blue-Chip 10 index, an index focused on only the most popular NFT collections like CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), is down by 44% in ETH terms and 1.7% in USD.</p>
<h2>Negative correlation between NFT and ETH prices</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/30/nft-prices-are-still-lagging-behind-ethers-gains/">comments</a> given to CoinDesk on Thursday, Nick Ruck, chief operating officer of ContentFi, attributed the subdued NFT market performance to the negative correlation between NFT prices and the price of ETH.</p>
<p>He noted that NFTs have survived their initial market cycle but haven&#8217;t witnessed a new technological breakthrough or significant user interest, unlike popular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-leads-decentralized-exchanges-in-2023-trading-volume-hits-all-time-high.htm">Uniswap</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the overall dip, there are signs of growth in the NFT market, particularly in NFTs based on utility in gaming rather than simple so-called JPEGs, and in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-ordinals-nft-collections.htm">Bitcoin Ordinals space</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin ordinals is not only a breakthrough for Bitcoin utility, but also a hub that brings communities together,&#8221; Ruck said, while noting that a number of entities from outside the crypto sector are currently exploring ways to get involved in the Ordinals craze.</p>
<p>“[…] everyone found a common ground and wants a piece of it,” he said.</p>

<p>The iconic Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) non-fungible token (NFT) collection has found a new home in the metaverse of Roblox, thanks to the metaverse-based &#8220;supergroup&#8221; Kingship.</p>
<p>Developed by Universal Music Group’s 10:22PM, the fictional band Kingship has expanded its presence from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spotifys-latest-experiment-playlists-unlocked-by-nft-holders-the-future-of-music-streaming.htm">token-enabled playlists on Spotify</a> to Roblox with the launch of the interactive game, &#8220;Kingship Islands,&#8221; a game where players find themselves in an island paradise after a crash landing and embark on a quest to unite the band members of Kingship.</p>
<p>The Kingship band features characters based on the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, as well as one character from the Mutant Ape collection.</p>
<p>Among other things, the Kingship Islands game allows players to earn certain in-game items for free in the initial six weeks after launch.</p>

<p>The Bored Ape Yacht Club creator, Yuga Labs, grants certain rights to NFT holders, enabling them to develop and sell derivative projects and products using the iconic artwork.</p>
<p>Launched in April of 2021, Bored Ape Yacht Club is known as one of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/goblins-flip-bored-apes-in-24-hours-to-become-the-top-collection.htm">most popular NFT collections</a> of all time.</p>

<p>The RARI Foundation, the nonprofit entity linked to the Rarible ecosystem, has officially launched the testnet for the <a href="https://rarichain.org/">RARI Chain</a> on Arbitrum.</p>
<p>This novel EVM-equivalent blockchain is designed to serve as a nonfungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/nft/">NFT</a>) infrastructure solution, embedding royalties directly into its nodes.</p>
<h2>Rarible Witnesses Massive Surge in Trading Volume</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The recent surge in Rarible&#8217;s trading volume acted as a catalyst for this initiative. Following a 585% uptick in the 24-hour trading volume on Rarible, the platform decided to exclude marketplaces lacking royalty support. This commitment to royalty enforcement and support evidently struck a chord with the community, setting the stage for the unveiling of the RARI Chain.</p>
<p>In a press release shared with CryptoNews, Jana Bertram, the Head of Strategy at RARI Foundation, emphasized the pivotal role of creators in propelling the NFT landscape forward. Bertram highlighted the importance of providing creators with robust tools and environments that contribute to their success, ultimately preventing their disintermediation from the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">Web3</a> growth.</p>
<p>Alex Salnikov, Co-founder of Rarible, echoed these sentiments, underlining the belief in a &#8220;creator-centric ecosystem&#8221; for Web3. The introduction of the RARI Chain, with royalties embedded at the node level, is positioned as a safeguard for creators&#8217; earnings. Salnikov emphasized that this approach transforms creator royalties from a mere promise into a tangible guarantee.</p>
<h2>Arbitrum, LayerZero, WalletConnect Support Rari Chain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The partnership ecosystem supporting the RARI Chain includes key players such as Arbitrum, LayerZero, Thirdweb, Gelato, WalletConnect, Magic, and Caldera, all actively contributing to the success of this new blockchain.</p>
<p>Nina Rong, the Head of Ecosystem Development at Arbitrum Foundation, stressed the significance of fairly rewarding creators for their efforts. Royalty enforcement at the node level, as facilitated by the RARI Chain, marks a substantial step in realizing this vision.</p>
<p>Founded in the year 2022, the RARI Foundation is a non-profit entity fulfilling the role of the authorized representative for the RARI DAO. Operating under the decentralized governance of $RARI token holders within an autonomous organization, the RARI DAO delegates pivotal responsibilities to the RARI Foundation.</p>

<h2>NFT news</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toniq</strong>, a company building professional tools and services on the decentralized web, today announced the launch of the first Ordinals-specific marketplace built on a <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-seeks-public-feedback-for-franklin-templeton-and-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">Bitcoin</a></strong> Layer 2. The press release describes Bioniq as &#8220;the world’s fastest Bitcoin-based non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/first-of-its-kind-nft-centric-wallet-by-magic-eden-set-to-transform-digital-collecting-nfts-making-a-comeback.htm">NFT</a>) marketplace&#8221; on the blockchain and Web3 platform <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/internet-computer/"><strong>Internet Computer</strong></a>. Bioniq has two objectives: facilitating a simple means of buying and selling Bitcoin NFTs and helping alleviate Bitcoin congestion, it said. Bitcoin fees have recently exceeded those of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/forbes-latest-under-30-list-data-will-be-listed-on-ethereum.htm"><strong>Ethereum</strong></a> by a large margin, making BTC transactions significantly more expensive. Backed by crypto-focused VC firm <strong>Polychain Capital</strong>, Bioniq was designed to solve these issues, helping users to buy, sell, exchange, and auction their Bitcoin NFTs seamlessly. Bioniq offers a built-in wallet with smart wallet features, and it allows users to manage their private keys by leveraging <strong>Web3Auth</strong>, enabling log-in with <strong>Gmail</strong> accounts in a non-custodial way. In the future, the platform plans to expand its list of available services by introducing &#8216;Launchpad&#8217; that allows the release of reserved Ordinals, or tokens on ICP with the exclusive right to inscribe on BTC; &#8216;Earn&#8217; that allows using Ordinals as collateral to borrow crypto; &#8216;Super offers&#8217; that enable placing offers on any inscription on Bitcoin and notifying the recipient; and &#8216;Collection offers&#8217; to make an offer on any Ordinal in an entire collection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Banking news</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>

<li><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/regulation-user-trust-and-tech-constraints-stand-in-the-way-of-mass-crypto-banking-adoption-says-brightys-cto-nikolay-denisenko.htm"><strong>Brighty App</strong></a>, a Swiss neobank powered by Web3, announced its European business-to-business (B2B) platform <strong>Brighty Business</strong>. <a href="https://financefeeds.com/bridging-b2b-digital-transactions-brighty-app-launches-eu-payment-platform-amidst-2-1-trillion-market-growth-forecast/">Per</a> the press release, focused on digital banking and cryptocurrency payments, the platform was designed to streamline how businesses manage their financial operations and support the market’s ongoing evolution. Its key features include virtual and physical company-owned debit cards that employees can utilize; transactional risk-checking; cost-effective exchange, including OTC (over-the-counter) exchange; and a referral program for all B2B customers. The new platform also provides an opportunity to implement its application programming interface (API) system into clients’ platforms. Brighty App’s B2B platform has already seen engagement and positive feedback from different companies in its pilot testing phase. The company also plans a series of user experience (UX) interviews with customers, it said.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mummolin, Inc.</strong>, a US corporation and a successor to the <strong>Eligius</strong> Bitcoin mining pool that operated from 2011-2017, announced that it raised $6.2million in seed funding, led by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jack-dorseys-block-reports-strong-q3-earnings-profits-from-bitcoin-holdings-surge.htm">Jack Dorsey</a>, <strong>Accomplice</strong>, <strong>Barefoot Bitcoin Fund</strong>, <strong>MoonKite</strong>, <strong>NewLayer Capital</strong>, <strong>the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund</strong>, and other strategic partners. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jack-dorsey-leads-seed-round-in-support-of-oceans-mission-to-decentralize-bitcoin-mining-globally---announces-launch-at-future-of-bitcoin-mining-conference-301999073.html">Per</a> the press release, the seed funding will support the launch of <strong>OCEAN</strong>, described as the first of many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-binance-shows-greater-net-flows-resilience-capital-is-flowing-out-of-us-into-asia-okx-applies-for-hong-kong-vatp-license.htm">mining</a> decentralization projects for <strong>Bitcoin</strong>. Bitcoin Core developer and Mummolin co-founder Luke Dashjr said that &#8220;the role of mining pools must change for Bitcoin to exist as a truly decentralized currency.&#8221; OCEAN, he added, is &#8220;a new type of pool that enables miners to be truly miners again. We are launching as the most transparent pool and also the only non-custodial pool where miners are the recipients of new block rewards directly from Bitcoin.&#8221;</li>
<li>Crypto earning platform <strong>Coinchange</strong> raised $10 million to grow its services. Per the press release, the round was led by <strong>G1.VC</strong>, <strong>Spirit Blockchain</strong>, <strong>Good News Ventures</strong>, <strong>K2.CA</strong>, and <strong>Atoia Ventures</strong>, with additional participation from <strong>Mintfox</strong>. The funds will support the company in expanding its operations and scaling its team and products &#8220;to make a meaningful impact on the financial landscape, leveraging unrivaled Yield farming strategies in decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/de-fi-2-0-revolutionizing-socialfi-antivirus-secures-5-million-in-funding.htm">DeFi</a>) markets.&#8221; Through its integrated Earn API services, Coinchange enables businesses to offer customers the ability to earn yield on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-hong-kong-will-use-all-available-methods-to-fight-crypto-scams-americans-are-much-more-open-to-potential-of-crypto-than-brits.htm">stablecoins</a>. With all its assets managed on the chain, Coinchange doesn’t have to rely on centralized counterparties for custody, trading, or lending and, therefore, potentially introduce counterparty risk to clients, it said. In addition to its Earn API, the firm also operates regulated and compliant brokerage services in the US and Europe.</li>

<p>It is &#8220;designed to give NFT collectors a faster and more seamless experience when collecting and trading NFTs across multiple chains,&#8221; the company said.</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Magic Eden noted that its wallet is set to become &#8220;a game-changer&#8221; in the digital wallet world.</p>
<p>It said that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Magic Eden Wallet is the first digital wallet to be integrated directly with an NFT platform, enabling collectors to do more with their NFTs directly from within their wallet. A first-of-its-kind in the industry, Magic Eden takes an NFT-focused approach that emphasizes features and a wallet experience centered around a user&#8217;s digital collectibles.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides the simultaneous connection to multiple chains, the wallet features include portfolio tracking and management of all NFTs and collectibles across chains without switching between multiple wallets.</p>
<p>Additionally, it enables buying and selling with fiat, and access to decentralized applications (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/dapp/">dapps</a>).</p>
<p>Users can manage and send Ordinals and BRC-20 with visibility into full transaction history, including pending transactions, it said.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/magic-eden-wallet-beta/mkpegjkblkkefacfnmkajcjmabijhclg">According</a> to the web store description, payment methods include debit card, bank transfer, and <strong>Apple Pay</strong>. The wallet supports localized currency in select regions.</p>

<p>Jack Lu, CEO and Co-Founder of Magic Eden, argued that there is &#8220;too much friction when it comes to collecting NFTs across chains.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team wants to make this wallet the only one users need, Lu said. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to start testing our wallet in Beta and bring that NFT-focused thesis to the public market very soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier in November, Magic Eden announced <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/magic-eden-and-yuga-labs-unveil-ethereum-nft-marketplace-to-protect-creator-royalties.htm">a collaboration</a> on the Magic Eden Ethereum Marketplace with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/legal-action-threatened-over-eye-injuries-at-apefest-bored-ape-nft-holder-speaks-out.htm"><strong>Yuga Labs</strong></a>, the maker of the popular <strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club</strong> collection. It would become the first major Ethereum marketplace with a contractual obligation to uphold creator royalties, the companies said.</p>
<p>A month earlier, the consortium of major companies <strong>OMA3</strong> (the Open Metaverse Alliance for Web3) <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bored-apes-creator-yuga-labs-magic-eden-collaborate-fix-nft-royalties-problem-whats-going-on.htm">formed a working group</a> to find the best way to standardize creator royalties on NFT marketplaces. The group announced a &#8220;defense of NFT creator royalties, including the support of Magic Eden, Yuga Labs, <strong>Animoca Brands</strong>, and the rest of our fantastic membership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in February, Magic Eden <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-uk-goes-after-unregistered-crypto-atm-operators-s-korea-watching-the-ripple-sec-battle-silvergate-execs-investigated-by-law-firm-bitget-to-collaborate-on-cbdcs.htm">partnered</a> with Web3 infrastructure company <strong>MoonPay</strong> to enable users to easily purchase NFTs with a few clicks using payment rails familiar to them.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/final-fantasy-publisher-square-enix-reveals-how-to-obtain-nfts-for-upcoming-game-symbiogenesis.htm"><strong>Square Enix</strong></a> has begun the character non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nike-rtfkt-nft-collections-generate-1-4-billion-in-trading-volume.htm">NFT</a>) auction for its game <strong>Symbiogenesis</strong>, less than a month before its launch.</p>
<p>The official website <a href="https://docs.symbiogenesis.app/docs/roadmap">shows</a> the game is scheduled for launch on December 21.</p>
<p>&#x200d;Once users log in to the game, an additional 400EXP will be added to the Daily Reward for holding the NFT Characters.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, be sure to hold on to these NFTs and have your <strong>MetaMask</strong> wallet and Discord account ready before starting the game,&#8221; the <strong>Final Fantasy </strong>series creator said.</p>
<p>As the launch of this <strong>Ethereum</strong> and <strong>Polygon</strong> NFT game approaches, Square Enix revealed auction details.</p>
<p>It will be held in three phases, <a href="https://twitter.com/symbiogenesisPR/status/1728043137128436142">according</a> to the company&#8217;s tweet.</p>
<p>The first one starts today, November 27, and lasts until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Phase 2 is scheduled for November 30 until December 1. The third phase will follow on December 2, also lasting 24 hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.symbiogenesis.app/docs/roadmap">According</a> to the website, the first phase is &#8216;Stakeholder Mint,&#8217; the second &#8216;Priority Mint,&#8217; and the third &#8216;AL Mint&#8217;.</p>
<p>Square Enix will launch only <a href="https://docs.symbiogenesis.app/docs/shopinfo">500 NFTs</a> for Chapter 1 of the game. Ten characters are allocated for the first phase, 90 for the second, and 400 for the third.</p>
<p>Users can bid only on one character in Phases 1 and 2. There are no limits in Phase 3.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the team announced additional perks for the bidders.</p>

<p>As <em>Cryptonews</em> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/final-fantasy-publisher-square-enix-reveals-how-to-obtain-nfts-for-upcoming-game-symbiogenesis.htm">reported</a>, there is no public mint for Symbiogenesis. Users had to participate in the Allow List Entry Campaign to mint NFT Characters in any phase.</p>
<p>Also, the Phase 2 Priority Mint offers a chance to get characters for free, but becoming top in rank in the Campaign is necessary.</p>
<h2>Auction Rules</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As noted, the auction is open only to those who were selected for the Allow List during the Allow List Entry Campaign.</p>
<p>For Phases 1 and 2, bidders who are outbid and fall below second place will be eligible to bid on a different character.</p>
<p>Participants in Phase 2 are eligible for Phase 3, where they are allowed to bid on more than one character.</p>
<p>The mint price for all phases begins from 0 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-eth-breaches-2000-resistance-time-to-buy.htm">ETH</a>. Bidding can be made in 0.01 ETH increments. Each bid will incur gas fees.</p>
<p>An English Auction will occur if other bidders are on the line. No midway cancellations are allowed for the bidder who is first in position.</p>
<p>If a bid is made within the final 5 minutes of a phase, the mint period for that character will be extended by an additional 5 minutes &#8220;to ensure a clearer final bidding process, as well to avoid potential confusion due to last-minute bids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Winners must claim their NFT Characters by December 6. The gas fee for each claim is the responsibility of the user.</p>
<p>Additionally, participants who hold onto their NFT Characters and log into the game with the same wallet by December 28 will receive an extra 5 Replica Issue Points on December 29.</p>

The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/nft/">NFT</a> trading platform incentivizes use by dropping tokens to users at the end of each season.

Blur has allocated 300 million tokens so far, with 38,000 addresses claiming their share of 267 million tokens.

<p>This season&#8217;s airdrop comes on the heels of <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/06/01/blur-opensea-nft-trading-volume-below-1-billion/#:~:text=Blur%20overtakes%20OpenSea%20even%20as,for%20first%20time%20in%202023&amp;text=Blur's%20trading%20volume%20dwarfed%20that%20of%20longtime%20leader%20OpenSea%20in%20May.&amp;text=Upstart%20NFT%20marketplace%20Blur%2C%20even,for%20the%20month%20of%20May.">Blur overtaking OpenSea as the top NFT marketplace</a> by Ether trading volume earlier this year. Blur&#8217;s growth seemingly prompted OpenSea to remove NFT royalty fees to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Despite benefiting from Blur&#8217;s rewards program, not all recipients are happy with the airdropped amounts. <a href="https://twitter.com/machibigbrother/status/1726780578379510162">NFT whale Machi Big Brother</a>, whose real name is Jeffrey Hwang, voiced frustration after receiving &#8220;only&#8221; $2.9 million worth of tokens.</p>
<p>Prior to Blur&#8217;s airdrop, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/250440">Hwang rapidly sold and bought back over 1,000 NFTs</a>. Some speculate this was an attempt to generate <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/63f9f602cf35b55d1cf30726/">wash trades and profit from the seasonal rewards</a>. While Hwang and others may not be satisfied, &#8220;hanwe.eth&#8221; is likely thrilled with their $12.1 million prize from Blur&#8217;s latest airdrop.</p>

<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> maker, the gaming giant <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/assassins-creed-creator-ubisoft-to-launch-free-ethereum-nft-event-for-champions-tactics.htm"><strong>Ubisoft</strong></a>, is launching a new set of non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/assassins-creed-creator-ubisoft-to-launch-free-ethereum-nft-event-for-champions-tactics.htm">NFT</a>) avatars for the popular metaverse game <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-mining-btc-for-free-bitdeer-is-preferred-csp-in-nvidia-partner-network-gucci-in-the-sandbox.htm"><strong>The Sandbox</strong></a> for 120 SAND each, enabling players to earn <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sandbox-going-zero-as-sec-deems-sand-security-but-new-ai-crypto-signals-platform-may-next-crypto-explode-heres-why.htm">SAND</a> along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Ethereum</strong> scaling network <strong>Polygon</strong> will launch a collection of 1,866 futuristic, cyberpunk player avatars presented as NFTs.</p>
<p>This is a limited edition set of 1:1 &#8220;Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix&#8221; characters, including Rayman, Dolph Laserhawk, and Bullfrog.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/captain-laserhawk/en">Per</a> the FAQ page,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;During the Allowlisting stage, one Avatar will cost 90 SAND. After this, during the Public Sale, one Avatar will cost 120 SAND.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Per the prices at the time of writing, this would be $37 and $49, respectively.</p>
<p>During allowlist days (November 28 and 29), only registered wallets will be authorized to mint avatars.</p>
<p>Only 200 avatars will be available for free on November 28 and will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>Users will be allowlisted based on specific criteria according to the NFTs they hold. The full list is available on <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/captain-laserhawk/en">the FAQ page</a>.</p>
<p>3,000 spots are available on the Allow List. <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/captain-laserhawk/en">According</a> to the website, registration for it will last from November 21 through 27.</p>
<p>The mint date is November 29.</p>
<p>Public sale will go live a day later, on November 30, while the reveal will happen on December 6.</p>
<h2>Earn SAND</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Sandbox website <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/captain-laserhawk/en">invited</a> users to play as a citizen of Eden and earn SAND.</p>
<p>Each avatar, it said, will be playable inside The Sandbox metaverse. They unlock features, events, rewards, and content.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are unique Play&amp;Earn opportunities for Avatar holders, giving any holder the opportunity to earn SAND and/or NFT through gameplay.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Underdogs, cyber-soldiers, TV hosts, rebel hackers, and military psychopaths, are all present in Eden, waiting to be collected, the company said, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Complete the quests of the Captain Laserhawk Blood Dragon experience to earn part of the 100K SAND pool and participate in exclusive community activations!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Each avatar is customized with unique, randomly generated traits. There are four types of these NFTs: super rare, rare, uncommon, and common.</p>
<p>Also, in a first for The Sandbox, avatars will come in three different sizes: small, medium, and large.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the end of the initial sale, players will be able to buy an unlimited number of avatars from users selling theirs on the <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-marketplace-opensea-to-reduce-workforce-as-it-is-planning-big-changes.htm">OpenSea</a></strong> marketplace.</p>
<p>Lastly, Eden Icons holders will receive an Eden care package.</p>
<h2>The Netflix Show</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The avatars are based on the French—American adult animated series &#8220;Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix,&#8221; produced by Ubisoft Film &amp; Television, <strong>Bobbypills</strong>, and <strong>Bootleg Universe</strong>.</p>
<p>The show is inspired by the 2013 video game &#8220;Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon&#8221; and includes a combination of elements and characters from several Ubisoft franchises, including Assassin’s Creed, <strong>Ghost Recon</strong>, and <strong>Splinter Cell</strong>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft first unveiled the show in October 2019, and Netflix released it in October 2023.</p>
<p>The experience is transporting the users into 1992 as citizens of Eden.</p>
<p><a href="https://heymint.xyz/captain-laserhawk-allowlist">Per</a> the <strong>HeyMint</strong> platform website, this is an original adventure filled with mystery, hacking, and stealth.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Fashion behemoth Nike has pre-launched new RTFKT Dunk Genesis sneakers that do not require an expensive NFT to buy.</p>
<p>The public presale of the new real-world kicks <a href="https://dunks.rtfkt.com/">went live on Monday</a>, letting anyone buy the sneakers without owning an RTFKT non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/nft/">NFT</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The drop is now live. The <a href="https://twitter.com/RTFKT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RTFKT</a> x Nike Dunk Ghost and Void editions are now available for pre-order at <a href="https://t.co/nVV3ffzdjv">https://t.co/nVV3ffzdjv</a>.</p>
<p>Oops, you stepped into the future! <a href="https://t.co/g28DMjV3wK">pic.twitter.com/g28DMjV3wK</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Nike (@Nike) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nike/status/1726632131705876835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The website noted that Dunk Genesis is designed with creators, gaming and internet culture. Further, the sneakers are equipped with removable mods and interchangeable vial attachments.</p>
<p>The phase 1 pre-sale live drop has ended on November 20 with two drop times. The RTFKT x Nike Dunk Genesis comes in two editions – Void and Ghost – which are sold at $222 a pair.</p>
<p>The Void edition shipping will take place before July 31, 2024, while the Ghost edition will ship before August, 31.</p>
<p>Additionally, the new launch is associated with t-shirts for the collab with both brand logos and a quote written in the front &#8211; “Oops, You Stepped Into the Future.”</p>
<p>The website confirmed that these are not digital collectibles and are real physical sneakers that are made-to-order.</p>
<h2>Embedded NFC Tags: What Are They?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The latest launch of Nike’s new RTFKT Dunk Genesis sneakers is tied to NFTs with an embedded near-field communication (NFC) chip within the sneakers.</p>
<p>These tags “will allow for the redemption of a digital collectible, however, this is an optional experience,” it noted.</p>
<p>It is unclear on which chain will Nike and RTFKT use to mint the associated NFT collectibles. RTFKT has previously been minted on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> (ETH).</p>
<p>The launch comes after both companies launched the RTFKT x Nike Air Force 1 sneakers earlier this year. The purchase of the previous version required an NFT to redeem for the real-world shoes. Another notable launch of sneakers required an Ethereum NFT to buy shoes.</p>
