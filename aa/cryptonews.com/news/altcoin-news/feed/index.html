<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin&#8217;s recent flash crash has sent shockwaves across the cryptocurrency market, impacting various gaming-related tokens. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On Wednesday, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a rapid decline of approximately 7%, prompting a domino effect that saw gaming tokens losing anywhere from 5% to 15% of their value.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to data from CoinGecko, following the Bitcoin crash, Immutable&#8217;s IMX token suffered a decline of around 9%, while The Sandbox&#8217;s SAND token dropped by about 12%. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Axie&#8217;s AXS token experienced a roughly 10% decrease, and the GALA token took a significant plunge of approximately 13%. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, Merit Circle&#8217;s BEAM token and ApeCoin fell by 9.5% and 13%, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Numerous other gaming tokens also faced losses within the past day, including the GMT token from the &#8220;move-to-earn&#8221; game Stepn, Enjin Coin, Parallel&#8217;s PRIME token, and WAX.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that these aforementioned cryptocurrencies have experienced overall declines over the past week, with their losses exacerbating following Bitcoin&#8217;s flash crash that occurred early on Wednesday morning. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over $500 in Longs Liquidated Along with Gaming Token Crash</span></h2>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More specifically, 172,626 traders were liquidated, with the total long liquidations coming in at $557 million and short liquidations coming in at around $58 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto exchange OKX took the lion’s share of these liquidations at over $230 million, followed by Binance at $105 million and Huobi at around $74 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin-tracked futures experienced $110 million in both short and long liquidations over the past day while Ethererum-linked futures saw over $82 million in liquidations. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the general downturn, a few tokens managed to make gains amidst the chaos. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Axie&#8217;s Smooth Love Potion (SLP) and Yield Guild Games&#8217; YGG tokens saw increases of approximately 4% and 11% respectively, seemingly unfazed by Bitcoin&#8217;s tumble. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Oasys also experienced a rise of about 6.3% within the past day, joining the limited group of tokens that escaped the chilling effects of the flash crash.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the current situation may seem challenging for lagging gaming tokens, it is important to note that some of them have recently achieved notable milestones. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">IMX reached a 20-month high of $2.35 last month, reaching prices not seen since the bullish market of April 2022. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GALA also witnessed an 18% gain during the same period, although its price has since dropped back to around $0.027, similar to mid-December levels.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Matrix on Target projects a January rejection for Bitcoin Spot ETFs by the SEC, cautioning traders to hedge long exposure,” the company wrote in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter). </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“With SEC Chair Gensler’s skepticism towards crypto, a potential -20% Bitcoin price drop is anticipated upon ETF denial, though a positive end-of-2024 outlook remains.”</span></p></blockquote>

<p>2023 saw a 51% decline in the digital assets lost to hacks, scams and exploits than that of 2022. However, a staggering $1.84 billion in cryptocurrencies were lost across 751 security breaches in 2023, blockchain security firm CertiK reveals.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/1f5aebc9-648a-451c-abd9-d3b471840d4d">2023 “Hack3d” report</a> published Wednesday, highlighted major exploits and incidents that led to this ten-digit number. Per the data, 2023 losses were down 51% from 2022’s total of $3.7 billion.</p>
<p>“Although $1.8 billion is a significant decline from 2022, it’s still too much,” CertiK analysts noted.</p>
<figure id="attachment_147224" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147224" style="width: 868px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-147224" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704363223-defillama.png" alt="" width="868" height="395" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704363223-defillama.png 868w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704363223-defillama-300x137.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704363223-defillama-768x349.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704363223-defillama-150x68.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-147224" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DefiLlama</figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, data revealed that the Q3 of 2023 saw the most losses at $686,558,472 from 183 hacks and scams. “November was the most costly month of the year,” it added.</p>
<h1>Private Key Compromised</h1>
<p>The study attributed the cause of several digital asset breaches to private key compromises.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Six of the ten most costly security incidents over the course of 2023 were due to private key compromises.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Private key compromises were the costliest attack vectors with $880,892,924 worth of crypto assets lost in just 47 incidents. The figures represent nearly half of all financial losses, though these compromises represented just 6.3% of all security breaches this year.</p>
<p>CertiK suggested some of the private key management best practices to avoid future breaches. These include multi-signature wallets, hardware wallets, access control policies, encrypted storage and regular monitoring of the use of private keys.</p>
<h1>CertiK Report Highlights Emerging Trend of Bug Bounty</h1>
<p>The report highlighted the emerging trend of “retroactive bug bounties” in 2023, with $219 million returned across 36 events. This represents 12% of the $1.84 billion lost in total, it added.</p>
<p>Several protocols have successfully negotiated “grey hat” bounties, leading to hackers returning significant portions of stolen funds. For instance, Euler Finance fell victim to a flash loan attack in March, resulting in over $197 million in losses.</p>
<p>The DeFi protocol later offered a $1 million bounty for information leading to the arrest of the attackers and demanded the return of the stolen funds.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Euler exploiter returned a total of 84,951 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">Ether</a>, worth approximately $147.8 million, and $29.9 million in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dai/">DAI stablecoin</a>.</p>
<p>Ronghui Gu, co-founder of CertiK, sees a positive growth in blockchain security in 2024. “The growth of bug bounty platforms and other proactive security measures is a good sign,” Gu said. “Hopefully, we will see a continued decline in losses throughout 2024.”</p>
<p>CertiK analysts further predicted that the crypto bull market will put the industry’s security to the test. “Looking ahead, the real test of DeFi’s improved security protocols awaits in the resurgence of a bull market,” the report added.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The expectation isn&#8217;t to eliminate losses entirely — an unrealistic goal in an industry that prides itself on cutting-edge innovation — but to continue reducing the correlation between total value locked (TVL) and losses to hacks and scams.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Decentralized exchange dYdX has </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://dydx.exchange/blog/sushi-yfi-incident" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">released</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a post-mortem report detailing the &#8220;targeted attack&#8221; it experienced on its v3 platform in November. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The attack <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/dydx-dex-and-yfi-token-hit-by-9-million-targeted-attack-heres-what-happened.htm">resulted in a $9 million loss</a> from its insurance fund, which represented approximately 40% of its total holdings.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the report, dYdX stated that investigative efforts have successfully uncovered the identity of the attacker and that the company is currently engaged in communication with them. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, the platform is exploring potential legal actions against the perpetrator.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Thanks to the efforts of our team, partners in the community and forensics contractors, investigative results have uncovered the identity of the attacker and we are in contact with them,&#8221; the DEX wrote. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;dYdX is assisting law enforcement in their investigation of this matter and is assessing all legal options. dYdX is committed to taking any legal action it deems appropriate in these circumstances.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How Did the Attacker Pull the dYdX Hack?</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the findings, the attacker executed a substantial number of 5x leveraged long positions in YFI, the native token of DeFi protocol Yearn Finance, across more than 100 wallets.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By purchasing spot YFI tokens using different addresses, the attacker caused the price to surge by 215%, as revealed by dYdX. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The attacker then reinvested their unrealized profits into additional YFI-USD positions, reaching a maximum value of approximately $50 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To restrict the attacker&#8217;s actions, dYdX increased the YFI-USD market&#8217;s initial margin requirement and adjusted the base and incremental position sizes on November 17.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, on the following day, the price of YFI plummeted by nearly 30% within an hour, and the attacker failed to close their positions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a result, the insurance fund automatically compensated for the losses incurred by the attacker, as explained by dYdX.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report also mentioned a separate incident a week prior, in which the attacker employed the same strategy but targeted SUSHI instead. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although the attacker withdrew approximately $5 million in profits, it did not impact the v3 insurance fund because dYdX had raised the initial margin requirement to 100%, preventing further earnings for the attacker.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">dYdX assured its users that no customer funds were affected by these attacks and indicated that the attacker likely did not profit significantly from manipulating the YFI market. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In response to these orchestrated attacks, dYdX has implemented updates to its v3 trading platform to enhance open-interest monitoring and alerting capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, dYdX mentioned that its upcoming v4 chain has been designed to mitigate risks similar to those encountered in this incident.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The upgraded chain incorporates a new software feature that automatically adjusts the initial margin fraction in response to abnormal price movements.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The default code of the v4 open-source software (the ”dYdX Chain”) is already designed with these risks in mind in several ways.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Blue chip cryptocurrency markets are mostly lower on Wednesday amid a fresh flushing out of leverage that may have been triggered by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/matrixport-analysis-sec-to-reject-etf-applications-in-january-with-final-approval-pushed-to-q2-2024.htm">FUD relating to the imminent expected approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US</a>, as well as potentially by macro headwinds as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/futures-point-fresh-losses-wall-street-yields-rise-2024-01-03/">US stocks pull lower</a> and US yields/the US Dollar rise at the start of 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) dipped back under $43,000, down close to 5% in the past 24 hours after hitting fresh 21-month highs near $46,000 on Tuesday.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ether</a> (ETH), meanwhile, was down closer to 6% over the past 24 hours and back in the low $2,200s, while <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> (SOL) was down around 7%, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a> (XRP) down about 6% and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano</a> (ADA) down about 9%.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/binance-coin/">Binance Coin</a> (BNB) was a rare gainer, up just over 2% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>With major cryptos pulling back from multi-quarter highs at the start of 2024, traders looking to turn a quick profit will continue to turn to the highly volatile and illiquid low-cap <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-shitcoins-buy.htm">shitcoin</a>/<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> markets.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest gainers on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> blockchain, according to Decentralized Exchange (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex.htm">DEX</a>) analytics and surveillance platform <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/gainers">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p><strong>OpSec ($OPSEC)</strong></p>
<p>A newly launched shitcoin called OpSec is up over 74,000% in the past 24 hours, according to <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x515d459555f8c1fcf2791ded819b73b60a80b8e3">DEXTools</a>, making it the best performer on the day.</p>
<p>It last had a market cap of just under $4 million, with over $2 million in volumes having changed hands in the past 24 hours, with around $260,000 in locked liquidity and with 532 holder, impressive stats given it only launched on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Investors should still exercise caution, with DEXTools’ security audit revealing the token has a 5% buy and sell tax, plus a few other concerning aspects to its smart contract.</p>
<h2><strong>AlphaNova ($ANVA)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Another just-launched shitcoin called AlphaNova ($ANVA) is up over 1,700% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x3da5954779a9b58410a820cc9a220637f4faf3d9">DEXTools</a>.</p>
<p>Its market cap was last around $460,000, with just over $200,000 in locked liquidity and more than 260 holders, with over $1.58 million having changed hands since the token’s launch.</p>
<p>But investors should be warned that DEXTools’ security audit has identified that the token is mintable, meaning it could be a scam.</p>
<h2><strong>Orbitt Pro ($ORBT)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A shitcoin called Orbitt Pro ($ORBT) that launched just under a week ago is pumping on Wednesday after a quiet few days.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x376475a1a96a0c6147c646305fbab3e89463f524">DEXTools</a>, the token was last up around 560% in the last 24 hours, with more than $600,000 having changed hands.</p>
<p>$ORBT last had a market cap of around $1.36 million, with locked liquidity of around $140,000 and over 450 holders.</p>
<p>DEXTools’ security audit identifies a few concerning aspects about the token’s smart contract, meaning investors should be cautious, include a 3% buy and sell tax.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Low-cap coins can offer huge potential returns but also come with a lot of risk.</p>
<p>For those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

<p>Ethereum layer 2 network Arbitrum has recorded high transaction volumes at the start of the year as well as its total value locked (TVL) tapping $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>On-chain data shows the firm&#8217;s bullish performance in the last week of 2023 and the early days of 2024 with surging transaction volumes and increased decentralized finance (DeFi) activity.</p>
<p>On Jan 3, its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/arbitrum/">native token ARB spiked over 10%</a> to trade close to the $2 mark with bulls anticipating a price surge as onchain activity ramps up. In the last seven days, the token has recorded a 26% increase and a massive 73.91% growth in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Amidst the price surge, its TVL is now above $2 billion as volumes on decentralized applications (dApps) moved past $900 million. The platform has also recorded a 24-hour inflows of $52.16 million with GMX leading the pack in TVL.</p>
<p>New market <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Arbitrum?volume=true&amp;inflows=true">data from DeFiLlama</a> points to Arbitrum’s DApps increasing TVL rising by 1 billion since October. The recent inflows have led commentators to toe the line of the wider industry&#8217;s uphill climb as a significant factor for the bullish activity.</p>
<p>The last quarter of 2023 was bullish for Bitcoin (BTC) and a plethora of altcoins based on several factors including increasing institutional investor appetite as they await a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-breaks-45k-etf-approval-looms-ais-100k-forecast.htm">spot BTC ETF approval</a> by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Described as a new window, several wealth managers explained that trillions are on the cusp of entering the market leading to a bullish drive across all sectors. Firms like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-rally-to-breach-50000-this-month-matrixport.htm">Matrixport projected a bullish</a> BTC price of over $50,000 at the end of January as the traders kept up momentum.</p>
<h2>ARB outpaces top assets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Aside from BTC, altcoins like Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) recorded growth in the later parts of the year after struggling with its institutional products at the start of the year. A key point is that the ARB token has outpaced other assets in the past days staying strong with its rising transaction volumes.</p>
<p>Other reasons for the surge of the asset could be linked to its developer incentives which have in turn led to wider community participation. In October, the network distributed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrum-airdrop-confirmed-heres-how-check-eligibility-for-arb-token.htm">$40 million worth of ARB tokens</a> to applications on its ecosystem with GMX getting the larger share.</p>
<p>According to some developers, the surge of the token and success of the overall network comes as the platform brings the Ethereum model with significantly lower transaction fees and ensures scalability.</p>
<p>With about 470 dApps on the network, increased on-chain movement could mean more growth for the platform extending its current lead above competitors.</p>
<p>Despite its recent successes, it faced a downtime on Dec 15 before a subsequent fix was implemented.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jupiter, a decentralized trading aggregator built on the Solana blockchain, has announced plans to conduct the airdrop of its JUP token in late January.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Meow, the pseudonymous founder of the protocol, the surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on the Solana blockchain, fueled by meme coins, the Jito airdrop, and the soaring price of SOL, has set the stage for Jupiter&#8217;s upcoming token distribution, which may serve as a litmus test for the sustainability of the altcoin frenzy.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), the founder emphasized that the protocol is not prioritizing hype or perfect price discovery, but rather aims to experiment with a major token distribution. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The airdrop, described as a &#8220;high-stress event,&#8221; is designed to ensure inclusivity by ensuring that &#8220;no cats are left behind.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nearly 1 million Solana wallets are qualified to receive a portion of the airdrop, representing 40% of the total supply of JUP tokens. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The protocol operates by routing token buy and sell orders through various on-chain trading venues to identify the best available price.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The distribution of such a significant number of tokens will not only stress test the JUP trading infrastructure but also the robustness of the Solana network itself, as highlighted by Meow.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The downsides are obvious &#8211; bots are likely to have a field day at the very start (I personally </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">don’t</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> think this is a downside), and the network is likely to be extremely congested at the start, with both claiming and bots hitting the pools early on,&#8221; Meow wrote. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;In addition, there is very little certainty in how much funds we will have at the end of the stablizilation period.&#8221;</span></p>

<h2>Is Binance CEO Richard Teng Changing the Industry’s Messianic Narrative?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Richard Teng, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-reports-30-surge-in-users-facilitates-18-more-trades-in-2023-emphasizes-compliance-strengthening.htm">new CEO</a> of <strong>Binance</strong>, has a vital additional role: to establish a new model of business leadership for the crypto world, EL PAÍS <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2024-01-02/richard-teng-binances-ceo-the-crypto-industry-has-changed-drastically-but-users-trust-us.html">argued</a>.</p>
<p>Teng, it said, faces the challenge of “shedding the messianic style” prevalent among the major players in the crypto industry.</p>
<p>The new CEO has complimented the old one, Changpeng Zhao, telling EL PAÍS that Zhao “has been a very inspirational founder CEO. He has done a lot of things for the industry.”</p>
<p>However, Teng’s leadership style seems to be the opposite of Zhao&#8217;s. In the interview, he made constant references to the staff that assists in maintaining the company and his experience in the regulatory sector, signaling that “the narrative will not be the same,” the report said.</p>
<p>“The landscape has changed drastically, but users trust us,” Teng told EL PAÍS, referencing a string of incidents hitting the sector. One of the latest was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-barred-from-travel-by-us-judge.htm">Binance’s own battle</a> with regulators globally and in the US.</p>
<p>“We made mistakes. In terms of compliance, control in those early days [2017] was still inadequate in some areas. As part of the resolution, we acknowledge those mistakes, and we are moving past them,” Teng said.</p>
<p>He made sure to distance Binance from cases like <strong>FTX</strong> or <strong>LUNA</strong>, saying that the US regulators found no instances of fraud in the use of Binance’s clients’ assets. Also, users were able to withdraw their investments from the platform at any time.</p>
<p>“For the first few days, there was a net outflow of funds from the Binance platform. However, that has changed: we have seen very robust inflows, and our user base continues to grow,” he added.</p>
<p>One thing that Teng shares with Zhao is that he will not reveal the location of Binance’s global headquarters. “We have already announced our regional headquarters. France is our regional headquarters for Europe. Dubai is our regional headquarters for the Middle East-North Africa region. When we are ready to make that announcement, we will do so. But we are a global company. We do global deployment,” he stated.</p>
<h2>Fidelity Sets Bitcoin ETF Fee at 0.39%</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-is-fully-priced-in-argues-analyst-glen-goodman.htm">ETF</a>) hopefuls have filed updates to their applications, revealing the details of how the ETFs would function.</p>
<p>Fortune <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/01/02/bitcoin-etf-fee-authorized-participant-fidelity-blackrock-galaxy-grayscale/">reported</a> that, in updated filings from December 29, two of the issuers released details on the fees that they will charge investors for the ETF.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-delays-decision-on-invesco-galaxys-ethereum-etf-until-february-2024.htm">Invesco/Galaxy</a></strong> announced that it would waive fees for its first six months of operation and for the first $5 billion in assets held. It will follow this with a 0.59% fee.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-calls-for-comments-on-fidelitys-spot-ether-etf-application.htm">Fidelity</a></strong> revealed its fee would be 0.39%.</p>
<p>Also, Fidelity, Galaxy/Invesco, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fund-manager-wisdomtree-reportedly-refiles-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-sec.htm">WisdomTree</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/valkyrie-anticipates-approval-of-spot-bitcoin-etf-by-sec-this-month.htm">Valkyrie</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-to-inject-10-million-into-seed-fund-for-upcoming-spot-bitcoin-etf.htm">BlackRock</a></strong> all listed the first authorized participants that they will work with, Fortune said.</p>
<p>Fidelity and WisdomTree named trading firm <strong>Jane Street Capital</strong>. BlackRock and Galaxy/Invesco, both named <strong>JP Morgan</strong> and <strong>Virtu</strong>, a market-making firm. Valkyrie named Jane Street and <strong>Cantor Fitzgerald</strong>.</p>
<h2>CleanSpark Plans to Launch In-House Trading Desk This Year</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
US Bitcoin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hydropower-fuels-kyrgyzstans-crypto-mining-industry.htm">mining</a> company <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miner-cleanspark-shifts-to-neutral-in-jpmorgans-ratings.htm">CleanSpark</a></strong> plans to launch an in-house trading desk in 2024 to maximize returns from its holdings of this crypto, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-02/bitcoin-miner-cleanspark-clsk-to-launch-crypto-trading-desk-in-2024">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Zachary Bradford, chief executive officer of CleanSpark, said that “we really think that doing it ourselves is the best way especially with the large Bitcoin balance we have. It just makes financial sense to do it in-house.”</p>
<p>Bradford further opined that other miners will likely start having trading desks in-house. “That way, you can manage it with your own risk profiles and expertise and keep a really close eye on it.”</p>
<p>CleanSpark plans to make strategies based on regulated crypto offerings such as the option contracts traded on the <strong>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</strong> (CME) or its affiliates, the report said.</p>
<p>“We may have to move a small amount into different accounts but we will keep the cold storage custody with holders like <strong>Coinbase</strong> with segregated accounts,” Bradford stated.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nearing the potential approval of the first <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> exchange-traded funds (ETFs), issuers are vying for an early advantage to capture investor interest.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Specifically, Fidelity has set a highly competitive fee of 0.39%, while Invesco/Galaxy announced a fee waiver for the first six months of operation and for the first $5 billion in assets held, followed by a 0.59% fee. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Analyst Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg has also predicted that BlackRock will likely set its fee at 0.47%, according to a recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/01/02/bitcoin-etf-fee-authorized-participant-fidelity-blackrock-galaxy-grayscale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">report from Fortune</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF has long been anticipated as a gateway to attract traditional investors, ranging from retail traders to asset managers, into the volatile cryptocurrency sector.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Previous applications for Bitcoin ETFs were rejected by the SEC due to concerns about the immature Bitcoin market and the potential for manipulation.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, after Grayscale, a prominent crypto asset manager, won a crucial court case against the agency in 2023, the SEC has signaled its intention to open the doors to this investment vehicle, which tracks the current price of Bitcoin.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">12 Issuers Are Competing for Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Currently, 12 issuers are competing for spot Bitcoin ETF approval, including industry giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In late December, the SEC requested issuers to submit their final revisions to their applications by the end of the year, potentially paving the way for a launch as early as January 10, the deadline for the SEC&#8217;s decision on the first applicant in line, ARK/21Shares.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As issuers refine their applications, the details of how these ETFs will function have come into focus. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A key question has revolved around the redemption model that issuers will adopt. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ETFs typically rely on authorized participants and institutional investors who create or redeem individual shares in the fund through an arbitrage system that maintains the ETF&#8217;s share price close to the underlying asset value. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, a Bitcoin ETF presents a unique challenge.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Instead of authorized participants directly buying or receiving Bitcoin from the issuer, the SEC has encouraged a cash model, placing the responsibility of Bitcoin buying and selling on the issuer. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This reflects the agency&#8217;s reluctance to involve broker-dealers in Bitcoin transactions.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In updated filings on December 29, Fidelity, Galaxy/Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, and BlackRock disclosed the first authorized participants they will collaborate with. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fidelity and WisdomTree both named Jane Street Capital, a secretive trading firm known for employing FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BlackRock and Galaxy/Invesco, a partnership between crypto firm Mike Novogratz and a traditional investment management company, named JPMorgan and Virtu, a market-making firm. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Valkyrie named Jane Street and Cantor Fitzgerald.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin Drops 8% after ETF Delay Rumors</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">On Wednesday, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/over-460-million-longs-liquidated-in-past-hour-as-bitcoin-drops-8-on-spot-etf-delay-rumors.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin crashed to as low as $40,000</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> after a report from Matrixport claimed the SEC is poised to reject spot Bitcoin ETF applications this month. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Matrix on Target projects a January rejection for Bitcoin Spot ETFs by the SEC, cautioning traders to hedge long exposure,” the company wrote in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter). </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“With SEC Chair Gensler’s skepticism towards crypto, a potential -20% Bitcoin price drop is anticipated upon ETF denial, though a positive end-of-2024 outlook remains.”</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> In a recent interview on Bloomberg TV, John Palmer, the president of CBOE Digital, said that ETF approval would unlock opportunities for institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin derivatives.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Palmer emphasized that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs would pave the way for pension funds and Registered Investment Advisor (RIA)-based funds to invest in these assets. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Currently, many funds face barriers when seeking direct exposure to Bitcoin. RIAs are companies registered with regulatory agencies to offer investment advice, and their entry into the Bitcoin market would mark a significant development.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The statement from Palmer comes just a week before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deadline of January 10, when it will decide whether to approve the ARK Invest 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF application. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The outcome of this decision could have far-reaching implications for the market.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBOE President Palmer Expects Expansion of Bitcoin Derivatives Products</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Palmer also anticipates a substantial expansion of Bitcoin derivatives products if a spot ETF is approved. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Institutional investors are likely to increasingly rely on these derivatives to mitigate risks associated with Bitcoin holdings.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While Palmer acknowledged that it is challenging to predict the breakdown of investors, he acknowledged that institutions are at the forefront of accessing hedging tools. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, he also believes that retail investors will seek similar opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBOE Digital, the cryptocurrency division of the exchange, is planning to launch margined Bitcoin and Ether derivatives trading on January 11. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This will enable investors to trade these contracts without providing the full collateral, potentially attracting more interest from market participants.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the wake of the anticipated ETF approval, some mutual funds have already started considering plans to gain exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Advisors Preferred Trust, a mutual fund manager, recently adjusted its prospectus to allow for potential indirect exposure to Bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, and Bitcoin futures contracts.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Eleanor Terrett, a journalist for FOX Business, a spot Bitcoin ETF approval seems unlikely amid vacations and work overload. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“While the SEC is surely unpredictable, it would surprise me if approvals were to happen tomorrow,” she said. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Layer 1 blockchain <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana (SOL)</a> continues to make waves in the crypto community as it achieves several significant milestones.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over the past week, the network surpassed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> in 7-day stablecoin trading volume for the first time ever. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to data from Artemis, the value of stablecoin transfers on Solana reached a staggering $103 billion last week, outperforming all other networks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum secured the second position with $90.9 billion, followed by Tron with $82.3 billion and BNB Chain with $14.6 billion.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Qiao Wang, a former researcher for Messari, also noted that Solana-based USDC has overtaken Tron-based USDT as the most transacted stablecoin by volume. </span></p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to stablecoin trading volume, Solana also </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-nfts-eclipse-ethereum-in-trading-volume-amid-surge.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">surpassed Ethereum in NFT trade volume</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for the month of December.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Degen News, Solana hosted trades worth $366.6 million, while Ethereum recorded $353.2 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, data from CryptoSlam reveals that over the past 30 days, Solana&#8217;s NFT sales amounted to $329.3 million, which is approximately 5% less than Ethereum&#8217;s $345 million during the same period.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The popularity of Solana is evident not only in trading volumes but also in search trends. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In mid-December, worldwide searches for &#8220;Solana&#8221; surpassed those for &#8220;Ethereum,&#8221; as reported by <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These milestones cap off a bullish year for Solana in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The price of SOL, Solana&#8217;s network token, skyrocketed by 936% from $9.97 at the beginning of the year to $103.3 at the end of December, demonstrating the market&#8217;s confidence in the network. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The positive momentum was fueled by the alleviation of concerns regarding FTX&#8217;s potential liquidation of its SOL holdings, as well as the increasing adoption of the Solana network.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, SOL experienced a slight dip of over 4% in the past week, retracting from its 2023 high of $121.4 achieved in late December.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solana&#8217;s DeFi sector has also seen impressive growth, with the network&#8217;s total value locked surging by 254% from $412 million in early November to $1.42 billion currently, according to DeFi Llama.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Solana had their strongest month to date in December, with $28 billion worth of trades, more than triple the volume of November&#8217;s $8 billion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jupiter, the leading DEX on Solana, accounted for $17 billion of the total. Solana ranked second in monthly DEX volume, trailing behind Ethereum&#8217;s $42.4 billion.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solana Sees an Influx of New Tokens</span></h2>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over the last two weeks alone, a staggering 72,202 new tokens have been minted on Solana using the SPL token standard. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This number is more than 71 times the amount of tokens created during a comparable period in October.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The daily statistics for new token creation on Solana are now consistently four times higher than ever before since the network’s launch in 2020. </span></p>

<p>Per the media outlet <a href="https://www.klerk.ru/buh/news/591977/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klerk</a>, recent tax code amendments – <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/russia-gov-t-hopes-to-monitor-crypto-transactions-2541.htm">signed into law by President Vladimir Putin late last year</a> – Russian tax authorities will “switch to collecting taxes in digital rubles from 2025.”</p>
<p>The media outlet added that the Ministry of Finance hopes to “begin paying pensions and other social benefits” in digital rubles.</p>
<p>The ministry has previously announced plans to make unspecified welfare and subsidy payments in CBDC coins this year.</p>
<p>As part of the expanding pilot, government organs have vowed to become more proactive with the coin in 2024.</p>

<h2>Taxes and More: Russia Building CBDC Infrastructure</h2>

Meanwhile, the news outlet <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/finances/26/12/2023/658990d09a7947153c8dcd4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RBC</a> reported that banks will be handed the power to block CBDC transactions.</p>
<p>The media outlet explained that the nation’s anti-money laundering regulator Rosfinmonitoring is currently working on related legislation with the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The new law will allow banks to stop digital ruble transactions. They will be able to step in if they “suspect” that “these are being carried out for criminal purposes.”</p>
<p>The media outlet quoted German Neglyad, the Deputy Director of Rosfinmonitoring, as stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Nothing should change for individuals for anti-money laundering procedures. Our basic position is that all anti-money laundering mechanisms that exist for other forms of the ruble will also work for the digital ruble.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Last year, the regulator stated that it was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-aml-regulator-says-its-monitoring-25000-crypto-users-heres-how.htm">monitoring some 25,000 Russian crypto holders in connection with money laundering suspicions</a>.</p>
<p>Rofinmonitoring chiefs say have developed a tool that lets them <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/russia-gov-t-hopes-to-monitor-crypto-transactions-2541.htm">track and de-anonymize crypto transactions on popular blockchain protocols</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> has performed well and just hit fresh 21-month highs above $45,000, but investors have been hunting higher returns by looking further up the crypto risk curve, and have been piling into the cryptocurrencies of high potential layer-1 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ethereum</a> rivals such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana</a> (SOL), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/avax-avalanche/">Avalanche</a> (AVAX) and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-sei-sei-price-blasts-up-25-as-sponge-v2-prepares-to-launch-on-exchanges.htm">Sei</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Is It Too Late to Buy Sei ($SEI)?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Investors who are looking to jump in and bag some $SEI have missed more than 7x gains from the October lows.</p>
<p>But given Sei’s still modest market capitalization of only around $1.7 billion, the cryptocurrency could still offer plenty of potential upside, meaning it probably <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/is-it-too-late-to-buy-sei-sei-price-blasts-up-25-as-sponge-v2-prepares-to-launch-on-exchanges.htm">isn’t too late to buy Sei</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine that Sei does experience significant adoption as developers build out Sei-based trading protocols to fulfil the blockchains use case, and that the broader crypto bull market continues to heat up.</p>
<p>Sei could easily see its market cap grow to more than $10 billion, meaning the potential for further more than 5x gains from here.</p>
<p>And if it is to become a serious contender of blockchains like Solana, which has a market cap of around $47 billion, we could be looking at gains in the region of 25x for $SEI.</p>
<h2><strong>Exciting New Meme Coin Launch Approaches</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Whilst Sei has seen plenty of hype, investors looking to bag gains in the region of 100x have probably missed their opportunity.</p>
<p>Investors looking to bag 100x gains might instead want to check out a high-risk/high-reward crypto investment strategy that has been growing in popularity in recent years – investing in token <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">presales</a>.</p>
<p>Cryptonews.com spends a lot of time analyzing which presales have potential, and one such project that they are big fans of is an exciting new project called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat/en">Meme Kombat</a>.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX is embroiled in a legal battle that could extend over several years as creditors seek to recover over $8 billion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The case, filed in November, involves multiple parties fighting over the remaining assets, making it more complex and time-consuming than other crypto bankruptcies, according to Alan R. Rosenberg, a partner at Markowitz Ringel Trusty &amp; Hartog.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rosenberg said he believes the FTX case will drag on for an extended period due to the litigation of various clawback claims. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These claims aim to recover funds that FTX paid out in the period leading up to its insolvency.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Given the significance of these transfers and the involvement of large organizations capable of defending themselves, the case could be protracted. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While these types of claims are typically resolved through settlements outside of court, negotiating such settlements can be time-consuming.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to fighting against clawback claims, FTX faces a substantial $24 billion claim from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for unpaid taxes. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This further complicates the bankruptcy proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX has already settled mutual adversary complaints with Genesis, a crypto firm also undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, unresolved complaints against FTX and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_Research">Alameda Research</a>, an FTX-affiliated trading firm, include a $1 billion lawsuit against crypto exchange ByBit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX is also attempting to recover $71 million from its philanthropic arm and seeking reimbursements from multiple celebrities for promotional activities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has identified potentially fraudulent transactions, leading to FTX suing its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, and other former executives, as well as Bankman-Fried&#8217;s parents. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More lawsuits related to FTX&#8217;s investments and political donations may arise in the future.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One Major Issue in the FTX Legal Battle is Determining the Value of Assets</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the key issues in this type of litigation is determining the value of cryptocurrencies over time. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There is a lack of definitive case law on valuing cryptocurrencies in avoidance action litigation. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A potential precedent is the 2014 bankruptcy case of crypto firm HashFast, which dealt with similar cryptocurrency avoidance issues.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another challenging aspect of crypto bankruptcies is deciding how creditors should be paid, whether in cryptocurrencies or fiat money. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Currently, there are no official rules governing this matter. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, given the increasing number of crypto bankruptcies and the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, legal experts like Rosenberg hope that new rules will be established to address these complexities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As reported, US prosecutors have decided </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-bankman-fried-unlikely-to-face-second-trial-say-us-prosecutors-heres-the-latest.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">not to pursue the remaining charges</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> against Sam Bankman-Fried, including allegations of foreign bribery and bank fraud. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the dropped charge of unlawful political donations that has sparked significant concern within the crypto community, given Bankman-Fried’s well-documented contributions to politicians from both major parties. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prosecutors had claimed that Bankman-Fried used customer funds to the tune of $100 million for political donations.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Expressing his discontent, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, took to X to denounce the decision as a “miscarriage of justice.” </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Line prosecutors and supervisors have far more information on a case than anyone on the outside ever will. So I’m always reluctant to second guess an agency filled with good people trying to do the right thing.</p>

<p>The timing aligned almost perfectly with the high during the price pump, adding to suspicions of market manipulation.</p>

On-chain analytics firm Spot on Chain also noted on X that 26% of the circulating supply of TRB was held by just 20 large wallets.</p>
<p>According to the firm, these wallets accumulated the token at a price of around $15, and the price has since then risen by around 15x.</p>

<h2>Synthetix users face losses</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to blockchain protocol Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, the large price moves in TRB led to around $2 million in losses for holders of his protocol’s native SNX token.</p>
<p>The losses were due to the sudden change in open interest and price of the TRB token which was not properly reflected in Synthetix’s decentralized derivatives markets.</p>
<p>“Several short positions were opened as the price spiked today and with the dislocation of spot and perp prices there was no [arbitrage] to balance it,” Warwick wrote.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">What happened? TRB had a 250k USD open interest cap that ballooned to 12.5m as the price ran up the last few months. This should have been adjusted back down, but risk controls were lax, there was diffusion of responsibility. The Spartan Council is responsible for params though.</p>

<p>Tellor is a decentralized oracle protocol, and TRB serves as the protocol’s utility and governance token.</p>

<p>The team behind Tellor has so far not issued any statements regarding the unusual price movements in TRB.</p>

<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval is Unlikely to Change Regulatory Environment in the US</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The approval of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-etf-decision-approaches-buy-the-rumors-sell-the-news.htm">spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a> will be a key step forward, say Steve Scott and AJ Nary of digital asset custody firm <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitgo-secures-digital-asset-custody-license-in-germany.htm">BitGo</a></strong>, but it&#8217;s unlikely that the bigger regulatory picture will be resolved any time soon in the US.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/spot-bitcoin-etfs-are-coming-but-not-as-soon-as-their-advocates-think">published</a> in the American Banker, BTC is the only digital asset considered a commodity at this time, so “a spot bitcoin ETF won&#8217;t likely pave a quick path to, say, an ETF basket of crypto assets.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it will allow advisors and investors to transition into the new asset class via ETFs as a familiar vehicle, said Scott and Nary.</p>
<p>They argued that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The approval of a spot bitcoin [ETF] is almost certainly a matter of &#8220;when&#8221; rather than &#8220;if.&#8221; Yet, bitcoin ETF approvals likely won&#8217;t come as soon as many people in the crypto industry would like to believe.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The two opined that we are likely to see another round of application rejections given the continued lack of clear market structure that led to the downfall of the crypto exchange <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbases-chief-legal-officer-slams-us-decision-to-drop-additional-charges-against-bankman-fried-calls-it-a-miscarriage-of-justice.htm">FTX</a></strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In other words, the lack of separation of custody and trading will continue to serve as a stumbling block for approval until it is fully addressed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, ETF applicants will likely need to show to the <strong>US Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-countdown-secs-decisive-december-deadline-heres-the-latest.htm">SEC</a>) that their assets will be custodied with one provider, ideally a qualified custodian, and traded using a different entity.</p>
<p>Whichever asset management company gets the first approval, a group of investment companies&#8217; applications that satisfy the above-stated requirement could be approved in rapid succession or even all at once.</p>
<p>“Predicting how quickly this will occur is a purely speculatory exercise,” Nary and Scott wrote.</p>
<h2>INX Says Customer Data and Funds Are Secure After Recent Attack</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Security token and digital asset trading platform <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-nigerias-government-approves-a-national-blockchain-policy-cex-trade-volumes-fall-for-1st-time-in-3-months-inx-works-with-bitgo-to-launch-a-pilot-wallet-management-solution-for-regula.htm">INX Digital Company</a></strong> said that on December 20, 2023, it learned of a cyberattack on the computer systems of a third-party vendor providing services to one of the company&#8217;s subsidiaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/inx-customer-data-and-funds-are-secure-after-recent-attack-on-third-party-service-provider-302023937.html">According</a> to the press release, a malicious actor accessed the vendor&#8217;s servers and executed unauthorized trades, leading to a $1.6 million loss for the subsidiary.</p>
<p>INX stated that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The customers were not affected by the incident, and the security breach at the third-party provider did not have any impact on the platforms and servers of INX.”</p></blockquote>
<p>No customer personal information or other data was compromised, and INX.One remains fully operational.</p>
<p>The company “took immediate actions to remediate the security vulnerability and to investigate the nature and scope of the incident.”</p>
<p>It also notified law enforcement and placed additional security measures in place.</p>
<h2>Bybit Web3 Partners with Manta Network</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Crypto exchange <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/okx-and-bybit-capitalize-as-binances-market-share-declines-more-news.htm">Bybit</a></strong> partnered with <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-privacy-protocol-manta-networks-team-valued-at-500m.htm">Manta Network</a></strong>, a privacy-preserving protocol using zero-knowledge (ZK) application ecosystems.</p>
<p>The Bybit Wallet now supports Manta, providing a seamless experience for over 800,000 users utilizing the Web3 Wallet, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/bybit-web3-partners-with-manta-network-celebrating-with-100k-manta-carnival-302023296.html">said</a> the press release.</p>
<p>“This integration not only expands the functionality of the Bybit Wallet but also brings the advantages of Manta Network&#8217;s ZK technology to a broader user base,” it added.</p>
<h2>Core Scientific Still Expects to Emerge from Chapter 11 by End of January, Despite Rescheduled Hearing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Crypto miner <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/core-scientific-finalizes-global-settlement-agreement-will-emerge-from-bankruptcy-in-january.htm">Core Scientific</a></strong> announced filing an amended plan of reorganization and extension of the subscription deadline for its Equity Rights Offering to January 5, 2024.</p>
<p>The Company previously announced a global settlement with all key stakeholders. While subject to further finalization, the Plan reflects the Global Settlement and represents another step towards confirmation and exit from Chapter 11, it <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231229388769/en/Core-Scientific-Inc.-Announces-Filing-of-Amended-Plan-of-Reorganization-and-Extension-of-Equity-Rights-Offering-Subscription-Deadline">said</a>.</p>
<p>The Bankruptcy Court also approved the company’s motion requesting to modify certain dates and deadlines with respect to the plan, including an extension of the deadlines to vote on the plan or file an objection to it.</p>
<p>The Court has agreed to reschedule the combined hearing to consider the final approval of the Disclosure Statement and confirmation of the Plan to January 16, 2024 (the “Combined Hearing”).</p>
<p>The company still expects to emerge from Chapter 11 in mid-to-late January 2024.</p>
<p>As a result of rescheduling the Combined Hearing, the deadline for participating in the Equity Rights Offering has been extended to Friday, January 5, 2024.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crypto enthusiasts have created a meme coin inspired by Mickey Mouse, the beloved cartoon character, after the first-ever cartoon featuring the iconic mouse entered the public domain.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The newly minted token, known as MICKEY, quickly emerged in the wake of Mickey Mouse&#8217;s public domain status. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The creators of the &#8220;Mickey Token&#8221; describe it as a representation of the timeless cultural icon and a reflection of digital culture. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The launch of the Mickey token not only marks his release into the public domain but also the beginning of a new adventure into the unknown,&#8221; the website reads.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The MICKEY coin is specifically inspired by the original Mickey Mouse character from the 1928 cartoon &#8220;Steamboat Willie.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The MICKEY token operates on the Ethereum blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is still in its early stages, with a market cap currently standing at a modest $6,500. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meme coins, such as MICKEY, are digital assets based on internet jokes, memes, or culturally significant figures. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">They are known for their high volatility, with prices fluctuating rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Under U.S. copyright laws, character rights are protected for 95 years. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Steamboat Willie, released in 1928 and directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, marked the first appearance of Mickey Mouse. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the 1928 version now being in the public domain, Disney has emphasized that they will continue to safeguard their rights over the more modern iterations of Mickey Mouse and other works still covered by copyright.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The public domain status of Steamboat Willie opens up opportunities for artists and creators to utilize the early version of Mickey Mouse in their own works without seeking permission. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that while the original cartoon is now freely accessible, subsequent iterations and adaptations of the character remain subject to copyright protection.</span></p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/frenzy-for-1000x-gains-drives-surge-in-new-tokens-on-solana.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the Solana network has experienced an unprecedented influx of new tokens this month, surpassing any previous records by a significant margin. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over the last two weeks alone, a staggering 72,202 new tokens have been minted on Solana using the SPL token standard. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This number is more than 71 times the amount of tokens created during a comparable period in October.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The daily statistics for new token creation on Solana are now consistently four times higher than ever before since the network’s launch in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the Solana ecosystem has witnessed a remarkable revival in the past two months, driving up the value of SOL, Solana NFTs, Solana meme coins, and even demand for the Solana smartphone, the sudden surge in token creation cannot be solely attributed to organic growth in network activity.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) is reportedly swamped with a substantial amount of paperwork as the January 10 deadline for the approval of spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> ETFs approaches. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to Eleanor Terrett, a journalist for FOX Business, a spot Bitcoin ETF approval seems unlikely amid vacations and work overload. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;While the SEC is surely unpredictable, it would surprise me if approvals were to happen tomorrow,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;From what I understand through conversations I&#8217;ve had with issuers, the SEC still has to review all the changes made to the S-1s filed on Thursday/Friday AND make comments on them.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Her comments were in response to speculation by crypto expert Scott Melker, who hinted at a potential approval today.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">While the <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SECGov</a> is surely unpredictable, it would surprise me if approvals were to happen tomorrow. </p>
<p>From what I understand through conversations I’ve had with issuers, the SEC still has to review all the changes made to the S-1s filed on Thursday/Friday AND make comments on… <a href="https://t.co/CnkYdXsbD4">https://t.co/CnkYdXsbD4</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1741929328919679458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Melker had shared the rumor that the first Bitcoin ETF in the United States could be approved as early as January 2. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, Terrett compared the situation to the approval process for Ethereum futures in October 2023 and pointed out the tight timeline, considering the recent time off for SEC staff.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;If the SEC follows a similar approval timeline to the ETH futures in October, the agency will, after this round of reviews, communicate to the issuers a date they want the final S-1s to be filed and make them effective in the subsequent 24-48 hours. SEC staff has been off since Friday, so a Tuesday or even a Wednesday approval seems tight,&#8221; Terrett concluded.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">No Communication From the SEC</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Adding to the discussion, FOX Business journalist Charles Gasparino reported that sources at BlackRock indicated there had been no communication from the SEC. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking re BTC ETF: People at <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackRock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlackRock</a> say it’s radio silence from <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SECGov</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EleanorTerrett</a>’s sources say the amount of paper work the SEC still needs to go through make the announcement likely toward week’s end</p>
<p>&mdash; Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) <a href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1741942501173240148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Terrett&#8217;s sources also suggested that the amount of paperwork the SEC still needs to go through makes an announcement towards the end of the week more likely. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This further supports the notion that the SEC is currently overwhelmed with the workload, potentially causing a delay in the announcement.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the SEC manages to approve the ETF proposals from firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, Bitwise, and VanEck by January 5, they would be slightly ahead of the expected schedule. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart had previously predicted that the SEC would likely approve a batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs closer to the end of the deadline.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We are definitely expecting it by January 10. Still, I think the official date is more likely January 8th &#8211; 10th,&#8221; Seyffart recently commented.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The statement came in response to a Reuters report suggesting that the SEC might notify issuers of their clearance to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs as early as Tuesday or Wednesday, paving the way for a launch in the following week.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC has historically denied or delayed spotcoin ETFs due to concerns over market manipulation and investor protection. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, following a landmark lawsuit loss to Grayscale Investments in August, the agency began collaborating more closely with a dozen firms to explore the possibility of bringing such funds to the market. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Many industry participants, including Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, believe that the SEC will approve multiple applications simultaneously to prevent any single firm from gaining a first-mover advantage.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Official Chinese media sources have raised concerns regarding the exploitation of cryptocurrencies by corrupt officials for illicit activities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The use of cold storage methods for cryptocurrencies, in particular, has become a cause for alarm as it allows these individuals to discreetly transfer assets out of the country. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cold storage refers to the practice of keeping cryptocurrency addresses and private keys offline, typically on hard drives or network disks, to reduce the risk of online theft and hacking.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The development highlights the broader challenge faced by governments worldwide in regulating and monitoring the use of digital currencies. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cryptocurrencies, known for their decentralized and anonymous nature, can be susceptible to abuse for unlawful activities such as money laundering and illegal fund transfers. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cold Storage Can Allow Movement of Funds Wihtout Oversight</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The use of cold storage by corrupt officials is particularly troubling as it enables the covert movement of significant sums without the usual oversight associated with traditional financial transactions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This method of transferring cryptocurrencies out of the country for transactions and redemption makes it difficult for authorities to trace and recover these assets.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For the global cryptocurrency market, developments like these serve as a reminder of the intricate relationship between digital currencies and regulatory frameworks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While cryptocurrencies offer numerous benefits, such as financial inclusivity and innovation, they also pose significant challenges in terms of regulation and oversight.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In response to these findings, the Chinese government has initiated a comprehensive strategy to tackle this new form of corruption. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Measures include enhanced surveillance of cryptocurrency transactions, stricter enforcement of existing anti-money laundering laws, and collaborations with international law enforcement agencies. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The government is also considering new regulations specifically targeting the use of cold storage in illicit financial activities.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">China to Verify Identities of its Residents through Blockchain</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Last month, China unveiled plans to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-plans-to-verify-identities-of-its-1-4-billion-residents-through-blockchain-based-platform.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">use blockchain technology for the verification</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> of real-name identities of its vast population of 1.4 billion people. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The announcement came from the Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN), China’s national-level blockchain initiative.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The initiative, named RealDID, was spearheaded by China’s Ministry of Public Security in collaboration with BSN. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The launch of the RealDID service will enable users to register and log in to websites anonymously using decentralized identity (DID) addresses and private keys. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This approach ensures that personal information remains disconnected from business data and transactions.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In October, Chinese state media reported that the country’s top six social media platforms, including WeChat, Sina Weibo, Douyin, Kuaishou, Bilibili, and Xiaohongshu, would require content creators with over 500,000 or 1 million followers to publicly display their real names or the names of their financial backers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More recently, the Chinese central government revealed plans to create a strategic document to guide the development of China’s Web3 ecosystem. </span></p>

<p>The attackers behind the recent Orbit Chain exploit successfully converted their ill-gotten gains into Ethereum (ETH), amassing an additional $1.45 million in unrealized profits amidst a 4.7% surge in ETH prices over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>The cybercriminals, responsible for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/orbit-suspends-cross-chain-bridge-contract-after-82m-exploit.htm">theft of approximately $81.6 million</a> from the Orbit Chain platform just hours before the new year, exchanged 30 million USDT and 230.9 WBTC for 17,250 ETH at an average price of $2,301. The conversion, valued at $39.7 million, allowed the attackers to capitalize on the upward momentum in ETH prices.</p>
<p>Orbit Chain later confirmed <a href="https://twitter.com/Orbit_Chain/status/1741725778956730778">an unidentified access to Orbit Bridge</a>, a cross-chain bridging service of the South Korean-based multi-asset blockchain. Following the breach, the project swiftly suspended the cross-chain bridge contract and engaged in on-chain negotiations with the attackers, as reported by Beosin Alert, an on-chain analytics platform.</p>
<p>Concerns about a potential exploit were initially raised by a pseudonymous Twitter user, Kgjr, on December 31. The user highlighted significant outflows from the Orbit Chain Bridge protocol. Subsequent investigations by blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that the hackers orchestrated five separate transactions, transferring various assets to new wallets.</p>
<p>Orbit Chain, renowned for facilitating cross-chain transfers between decentralized networks, particularly EVM-compatible networks and Klaytn, now faces the aftermath of this high-profile breach. The protocol, deeply integrated with the Klaytn network, experienced a substantial loss as eight of the largest assets on Klaytn were wrapped assets on the Orbit Bridge.</p>
