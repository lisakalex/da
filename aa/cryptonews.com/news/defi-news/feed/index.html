<p><b>Blockchain technology</b> is witnessing a major shift—one that promises to reshape how we think about and interact with <b>digital ledgers</b>. We&#8217;re talking about the emergence of parallelized <b>Ethereum Virtual Machines</b> (EVMs), a development that may redefine transaction processing in blockchain networks.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs offer an alternative to how blockchain networks currently manage and process transactions. By reducing congestion, especially during periods of high demand, <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fanl/papers/parallel-icse22.pdf">parallel execution</a> offers a more streamlined and efficient experience for users.</p>
<h2>Understanding Parallelized EVMs and Their Impact on Blockchain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Historically, the execution of operations in blockchain networks has followed a <b>sequential pattern</b>. Each transaction within a block is processed one after the other, demanding comprehensive validation from the network. While this method has underpinned the robust and secure nature of blockchain technology, it has not been without its drawbacks.</p>
<p><iframe title="What Is The EVM In 2 Minutes (Ethereum Virtual Machine)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTlT3I-Iy5o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4274&amp;context=thesesdissertations">Sequential processing</a> is both energy-intensive and places a high workload on network validators. The result has often been <b>high transaction costs</b> and a <b>less efficient user experience</b>—issues that have frequently been cited as barriers to wider <b>blockchain adoption</b>.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs transform the consensus process by enabling multiple operations to be executed simultaneously. The parallel execution capability greatly increases the <b>network&#8217;s throughput</b>, enhancing the overall performance and <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/89f5c7cd-c139-486c-8f35-00f15d7b21fe/content">scalability of the blockchain</a>.</p>
<p>With Parallelized EVMs, blockchain networks can handle more transactions in a shorter period, effectively addressing <b>congestion issues</b> and <b>slow processing times</b> that have often plagued traditional blockchain systems.</p>
<p>The impact extends to various aspects of blockchain technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>It offers a more <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6287639/10005208/10102454.pdf">energy-efficient approach</a> to transaction processing. By reducing the workload on validators and the network at large, parallelized EVMs contribute to a more <b>sustainable blockchain</b> ecosystem.</li>
<li>The enhanced scalability and increased throughput directly translate to reduced transaction fees. Users benefit from a more <b>cost-effective</b> experience, making blockchain platforms more accessible and appealing to a broader audience.</li>
<li>The ability to process multiple transactions concurrently rather than sequentially means <b>decentralized applications</b> (dApps) can operate more seamlessly, even during periods of high network demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>This technological advancement not only improves the user experience but also opens new possibilities for complex and high-volume applications on the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Parallelized EVMs in Ethereum and Beyond</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The benefits of parallelized EVMs are not confined to Ethereum alone. They are also being integrated into other blockchain platforms, such as Solana, which is known for its <a href="https://solana.com/news/case-study-pyth">high throughput and low latency</a>.</p>
<p>By adopting a parallelized EVM on a platform like Solana, the potential for scalability and performance is magnified. This integration allows for a seamless execution of transactions across multiple nodes concurrently, greatly enhancing the network&#8217;s capacity to handle large volumes of transactions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">CT saying parallelized chains are the future</p>
<p>Parallelized chains are the *present*. </p>

<p>Go try one. Compare the speed. Compare the fees to these</p>
<p>Just try. <a href="https://t.co/31SCcpN7KD">pic.twitter.com/31SCcpN7KD</a></p>
<p>&mdash; GJ Flannery (@GJFlannery19) <a href="https://twitter.com/GJFlannery19/status/1736955357014946282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This advancement is particularly crucial for a wide range of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-build-decentralized-application-dapp.htm">decentralized applications</a>. Whether it&#8217;s in the DeFi, gaming, decentralized autonomous organizations, or <strong>decentralized exchanges</strong>, the adoption of parallelized EVMs will ensure that these applications can operate efficiently without overwhelming the network.</p>
<p>This is a critical factor in ensuring the long-term viability and success of dApps, as it addresses <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/24941/blockchain-and-the-scalability-challenge-solving-the-blockchain-trilemma">one of the biggest challenges they face</a>: scalability.</p>
<h3>The Developer&#8217;s Role in Maximizing Benefits</h3>
<p>The successful implementation and optimization of parallelized EVMs are heavily reliant on the foresight and skill of developers. To fully harness the <a href="https://suipiens.com/blog/understanding-parallel-execution-in-blockchain/">capabilities of parallelized technology</a> in blockchain, developers must integrate considerations for parallel processing from the inception of their projects.</p>
<p>This is particularly crucial when designing <strong>smart contracts</strong> and data structures, as these elements play a key role in determining whether transactions can be executed in parallel.</p>
<p>In the context of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a>, the design must accommodate parallel execution to ensure different transactions can operate independently without interference. For example, if a smart contract utilizes the same data structure for various transactions, it restricts the possibility of <strong>parallel processing</strong>. Developers must carefully structure their contracts and associated data to avoid such limitations.</p>
<p>The requirement for thoughtful design extends to <strong>data structures</strong> as well. Effective use of parallelized EVMs necessitates data structures that support <strong>independent transactions</strong>. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of transaction processing but also ensures that the full potential of parallelized technology is leveraged.</p>
<p>The role of developers, therefore, is not just about coding but also about <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37902833/">architectural planning</a> and strategic thinking. By designing with parallel processing in mind, developers can create dApps that are not only novel but also capable of operating at an unprecedented scale and efficiency.</p>
<p>This proactive approach is essential in unlocking the power of parallelized EVMs, making blockchain technology more <strong>adaptable, efficient, and scalable</strong>.</p>
<h2>Comparing Parallelized EVMs with DAG</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As a scalable blockchain technology, parallelized EVMs represent a major advancement. It&#8217;s instructive to compare them with other scalable technologies, however, such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34460402/">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</a>, to appreciate their unique contributions and potential in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>DAG presents an alternative approach to achieving scalability. Unlike traditional blockchains that chain blocks in a linear sequence, DAG structures allow <a href="https://hedera.com/learning/distributed-ledger-technologies/directed-acyclic-graph">transactions to be linked in a graph format</a>, where multiple transactions can be added concurrently.</p>
<figure id="attachment_145839" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145839" style="width: 1227px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-145839 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt.png" alt="Directed Acyclic Graph vs Blockchain" width="1227" height="323" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt.png 1227w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-300x79.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-1024x270.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-768x202.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-150x39.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1227px) 100vw, 1227px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-145839" class="wp-caption-text">Image by <a href="https://www.cbcamerica.org/blockchain-insights/dag-the-dlt-directed-acyclic-graph-for-enterprise-blockchain">Central Blockchain Council</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This structure substantially reduces the time needed for transaction confirmation and increases the network&#8217;s ability to handle <strong>high transaction volumes</strong>. DAG technology is known for its low transaction fees and high scalability, making it an attractive choice for applications requiring fast and efficient transaction processing.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs offer distinct advantages over DAG, however, particularly in the context of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/top-5-ethereum-dapp-games-1979.htm">Ethereum-based applications</a>. While DAG excels in transaction speed and scalability, it does not inherently support smart contracts and decentralized applications in the same way Ethereum does.</p>
<p>They retain the robust smart contract capabilities of Ethereum while enhancing scalability and efficiency through parallel processing. This makes them particularly suitable for complex decentralized applications that require both smart contract functionality and high transaction throughput.</p>
<p>Additionally, parallelized EVMs maintain compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem, which is a critical consideration for developers and users already entrenched in Ethereum-based applications. This compatibility ensures a smoother transition and integration for existing dApps, which is a challenge in DAG-based systems that often require major modifications to existing applications.</p>
<h2>Spotlight on Projects Developing Parallelized EVMs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The evolution of parallelized EVMs is not occurring in isolation. Several projects are leading the charge of this technological shift, each contributing unique insights and advancements to the blockchain world. Three such projects—SEI, Neon EVM, and Monad—are working to integrate the technology into their platforms, setting new benchmarks in blockchain scalability and efficiency.</p>
<h3>SEI v2’s Parallelized EVM Update</h3>
<p><strong>SEI Network</strong> is gearing up for a big leap forward with its version 2 (v2) update, scheduled to enter testnet in Q1 2024. <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-the-first-parallelized-evm/">SEI v2</a> will integrate a parallelized EVM, marking a synergistic blend of Solana&#8217;s high-performance capabilities with the extensive tooling and community support inherent to Ethereum.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market has recently seen growing interest in an <strong>emerging trend</strong>—the development of <strong>parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines</strong> (EVMs). <strong>Parallelized EVM</strong> technology is promising major improvements in <strong>blockchain scalability</strong> through parallel transaction processing. But is the hype justified or is this just another crypto fad?</p>
<h2>Focused Attention on Parallelized EVM Trend</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/128749">An EVM</a> is the software that handles computation and data storage on the <strong>Ethereum blockchain</strong> network. The EVM processes <strong>smart contract</strong> code and executes transactions on the network. Ethereum&#8217;s EVM utilizes sequential transaction ordering, however, which limits its <strong>ability to scale</strong>.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs seek to break this bottleneck by enabling parallel transaction execution across multiple processors. This allows for higher throughput and lower latency compared to sequential processing.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">2024 will be the year of the parallel evm &#8211; rooting for everyone working on this problem incl. monad/sei/polygon and other teams that I forget. </p>
<p>also excited for our own internal efforts there and pushing the boundaries on database design</p>
<p>&mdash; Georgios Konstantopoulos (@gakonst) <a href="https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1734253305847767385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As New York-based crypto investment firm DBA co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_charb">Jon Charbonneau explains</a>, there are two main approaches for building parallelized EVMs—<strong>deterministic</strong> and <strong>speculative parallel execution</strong>. The deterministic method uses predefined transaction ordering to avoid conflicts, while speculative scheduling speculatively runs transactions in parallel, managing conflicts as they arise.</p>
<p>Proponents argue that parallelized EVMs can optimize <strong>blockchain performance</strong> and efficiency. By splitting workloads across multiple processors, these parallelized systems can handle far greater transaction volumes, enabling <strong>greater application scalability</strong>, and reducing network congestion and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/high-gas-fees-alert-binance-wallet-records-840000-abnormal-ethereum-charges.htm">high gas fees</a> during peak usage.</p>
<h2>The Promise of Faster, More Efficient Blockchains</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Parallelized EVM projects have rapidly grown in popularity as the crypto market focuses on their potential benefits. Leading projects like <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sei/">SEI</a> and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neon/">NEON</a> have seen surging adoption and valuations this year.</p>
<p>The crypto community views these technologies as crucial for addressing fundamental <a href="https://www.academia.edu/92613223/Scalability_Issues_of_Blockchain_Technology?f_ri=922887">limitations in blockchain scalability</a>. As <strong>decentralized apps (DApps)</strong> and user bases expand, parallel execution is seen as critical for meeting demands.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think many established L1s/L2s are now facing existential crisis from inscription spamming causing gas like <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AVAX&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$AVAX</a> to go to $50-$100 per tx, completely destroying their core values.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs can open the door to sophisticated <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-defi.htm">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) products not feasible on current networks. By powering faster and <strong>cheaper transactions</strong>, these could enable the next generation of blockchain technology.</p>
<h2>Technical Hurdles and Adoption Risks</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Building functioning parallelized systems requires overcoming complex technical obstacles, however. Ensuring predictable, conflict-free parallel execution across thousands of <strong>decentralized nodes</strong> is challenging.</p>
<p>There are also questions about <strong>ecosystem adoption</strong>. While <a href="https://polynya.medium.com/why-the-transition-to-rollup-centric-ethereum-is-a-years-long-journey-f1e25c200660">Ethereum is transitioning to integrate optimized rollup</a> technologies, it can take time. And some applications may be difficult to migrate.</p>
<p>The rise of parallelized EVMs and rollups represents a key juncture for blockchain tech. These innovations address innate limitations in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.826/www/notes/HO19.pdf">sequential transaction processing</a> that have long-constrained performance.</p>
<p>If successfully implemented, parallelized EVMs could future-proof blockchain networks. They could provide the pathway for Ethereum and other crypto networks to keep pace with soaring demands.</p>
<p>While technical and adoption risks exist, the crypto market is betting on parallelized EVMs becoming a cornerstone of the next-generation Web3 infrastructure. Their success could determine whether blockchains can truly scale to mainstream levels.</p>

<p>The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which sets standards for securities market regulation globally, has issued policy recommendations for the supervision of decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
<p>On December 19, IOSCO unveiled <a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD754.pdf">nine policy recommendations</a> aimed at regulating the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. This guidance comes as regulators worldwide grapple with the challenges of regulating DeFi, an industry that lacks a centralized body subject to traditional supervision.</p>
<p>These recommendations, part of a comprehensive approach initiated last year, seek to foster greater consistency in regulatory oversight both within and across jurisdictions. Notably, IOSCO had previously published recommendations for regulating crypto markets in September.</p>
<p>In its latest report, IOSCO highlights the need for governments to identify those responsible for innovative financial applications within the DeFi space and regulate them similarly to traditional finance. While some of the recommendations may appear standard, their significance lies in the detailed treatment provided for each.</p>
<p>For instance, Recommendation 7 emphasizes the enforcement of applicable laws and guides on assessing regulators&#8217; powers, tools, and resources to address potential evasion by DeFi or other market participants.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of responsible innovation benefiting investors and markets, IOSCO underscores the necessity of addressing market integrity and investor protection concerns arising from technological developments in DeFi.</p>
<p>These recommendations, aligned with IOSCO&#8217;s Crypto-Asset Roadmap, complement those issued for Crypto and Digital Assets (CDA) markets in November 2023. Following a lifecycle approach, the principles-based and outcomes-focused recommendations aim at DeFi products, services, activities, and arrangements. They adhere to IOSCO&#8217;s globally accepted standards for securities market regulation.</p>
<p>The report emphasizes that many existing international policies, standards, and regulatory frameworks for traditional financial markets are applicable to DeFi due to their similar economic functions and activities. In cases where current rules don&#8217;t directly apply, IOSCO suggests modifying them to ensure proper regulation.</p>
<h2><b>IOSCO urges Global Cooperation for Consistent Regulation</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
IOSCO&#8217;s guidance on DeFi covers key aspects such as identifying responsible individuals, establishing clear disclosure requirements, and enforcing applicable laws. The definition of responsible persons includes those &#8220;exercising control or sufficient influence over a financial product offered, financial service provided, or financial activity engaged in by the DeFi arrangement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IOSCO&#8217;s overarching goal is to promote consistency in the regulation and oversight of crypto-asset markets, emphasizing the need for uniformity in regulating crypto-asset and securities markets within individual jurisdictions. The recommendations stress the importance of enhanced cooperation among regulators to address cross-border challenges, enforce regulations, and supervise DeFi participants engaging in global crypto-asset activities across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>With these recommendations in place, IOSCO is now shifting its focus towards implementation, capacity building, and providing technical assistance to regulators adopting the suggested frameworks. While the recommendations are not directly aimed at market participants, IOSCO strongly encourages all crypto-asset market participants to thoroughly consider the expectations outlined in the recommendations and supporting guidance, especially in the conduct of regulated and cross-border activities.</p>
<p>Having completed the recommendations, IOSCO is set to shift its focus to monitoring, regulatory capacity building, and providing technical assistance to its over 130 member authorities, which collectively regulate 95% of the world&#8217;s financial markets.</p>
<p>The board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) includes 35 regulators and top executives, including heads of prominent regulatory bodies such as the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), among others.</p>
<p>In 2022, IOSCO released <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bis-says-stablecoin-issuers-must-provide-information-management-structure-status-of-reserves.htm">comprehensive reports</a> on various aspects of the crypto landscape, covering topics such as DeFi, stablecoins, and the role of influencers. The organization has consistently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/global-standard-setter-recommends-more-investor-protection-following-turmoil-over-past-year.htm">advocated for national regulators</a> to enhance their supervisory capacities in response to the evolving nature of the crypto industry.</p>

<h2>Decentralization Hoped to Reinvigorate the Ethereum Fork</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <strong>Ethereum hard fork</strong> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ethw-goes-live-6674485">occurred in September 2022</a>, just before the main Ethereum blockchain transitioned from PoW consensus to a more energy-efficient <strong>proof-of-stake model</strong> following the <strong>Merge upgrade</strong>.</p>
<p>Some developers and miners unhappy with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-report-ethereums-centralization-increased-post-merge-shanghai-upgrades.htm">the perceived centralization and loss of revenues</a> created EthereumPOW to preserve the original PoW-based Ethereum. Since its launch, the forked token <strong>ETHW</strong> has struggled to gain adoption, however.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-143613" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703004111-ethw_all_graph_coinmarketcap.jpeg" alt="" width="975" height="396" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703004111-ethw_all_graph_coinmarketcap.jpeg 975w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703004111-ethw_all_graph_coinmarketcap-300x122.jpeg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703004111-ethw_all_graph_coinmarketcap-768x312.jpeg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703004111-ethw_all_graph_coinmarketcap-150x61.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grayscale-abandons-post-merge-ethereum-005655194.html">Grayscale decided against supporting ETHW</a> in September, citing a lack of liquidity and custodial support. This removed a major source of potential demand. As a result, ETHW has declined from its launch price of $100 to around $2.59 currently.</p>
<p>By dissolving centralized control and embracing <strong>community governance</strong>, the EthereumPOW team hopes to reinvigorate the network. OneDAO will provide technical assistance during the transitional period as the developers step back. Still, success will ultimately hinge on whether the cryptocurrency community chooses to adopt EthereumPOW over the dominant <strong>Ethereum PoS</strong> blockchain.</p>

<p>Ethereum is one of the most widely used blockchain networks globally. Recent <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/64d01c8d3e922f69b35d7f0a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">findings</a> from CoinMarketCap show that Ethereum has the highest number of total developers, accounting for 16% of all developers in the crypto sector.</p>
<figure id="attachment_142932" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142932" style="width: 1274px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-142932 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm.png" alt="" width="1274" height="716" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm.png 1274w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm-1024x575.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1274px) 100vw, 1274px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-142932" class="wp-caption-text">Source: CoinMarketCap</figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, the Ethereum network has also become extremely prone to security exploits. Blockchain security firm Beosin <a href="https://medium.com/@Beosin_com/q3-2023-global-web3-security-report-aml-analysis-crypto-regulatory-landscape-9f4c646ca71" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> in its “Global Web3 Security Report &#8221; that crypto investors lost $282.96 million to rug pulls during quarter three of this year. The report further noted that phishing schemes generated $66.15 million during the same time period. According to findings from Beosin, the Ethereum blockchain underwent the most losses and incidents overall.</p>

<h2><b>Updated framework for reviewing smart contract code</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chaals Nevile, technical program director at the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) — an organization that aims to drive the use of enterprise ethereum as an open standard — told Cryptonews that there are known problems within Ethereum that are impacting the ecosystem’s security. “The most obvious problem is that the Solidity compiler – which outputs byte code and other artifacts needed for deployment of smart contracts – has bugs. As the compiler evolves, old bugs are fixed, but new ones are also created,” said Nevile.</p>
<p>In order to address this and other challenges, the EEA established the “<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-advances-with-standards-for-smart-contract-security-audits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EthTrust Security Levels Working Group in November 2020</a>.” In August 2022, the group released the publication of the “EthTrust Security Levels Specification v1.” This specification has since served as a framework for developers, organizations and customers leveraging and reviewing smart contract code written in Solidity, Ethereum’s main programming language.</p>
<p>Yet as the Ethereum network continues to advance, Nevile pointed out that the EthTrust Security Levels Specification required updates to reflect ongoing and new security developments. “For instance, the v1 specification covers bugs up to about the year 2022, yet new bugs were discovered after we released v1,” he said.</p>
<p>This in mind, Nevile shared that today the EEA announced the release of<a href="http://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Version 2.0 of its EthTrust Security Levels Specification</a>. Neville noted that the EthTrust Security Levels Specification v2 addresses issues such as newly discovered bugs in the <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solidity-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solidity compiler</a>, treatment of rounding errors, more vigorous treatment of read-only reentrancy attacks and more.</p>
<p>Updates are critical, as the Ethereum ecosystem has fallen victim to security exploits in the past due to these specific issues. For instance, Michael Lewellen, head of solutions architecture at OpenZeppelin – a security firm building an open-source framework to secure smart contracts – told Cryptonews that “<a href="https://neptunemutual.com/blog/the-story-behind-the-dao-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The DAO</a>” hack occurred due to reentrancy. “The DAO Hack was the original big hack on Ethereum that happened in 2016 and got everyone thinking more about security. This was a classic case of reentrancy,” Lewellen said. The DAO hack resulted in a loss of $3.64 million in ETH.</p>
<p>Nevile explained that <a href="https://medium.com/@zokyo.io/read-only-reentrancy-attacks-understanding-the-threat-to-your-smart-contracts-99444c0a7334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reentrancy</a> occurs when a developer starts a smart contract and then requests for the program to do something different while it is in the middle of running code. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Essentially this means that a program is halfway through running code, but then something else is asked of it. As a result, the two requests could get mixed up. A program hacker can then use this mix up as an opportunity to steal people&#8217;s money or change the prompt of things.”</p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Will an industry standard be widely adopted? </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Aware of the severity behind such incidents, Lewellen pointed out that OpenZeppelin leverages the EthTrust Security Levels v1 framework to prevent such security vulnerabilities from occurring. “We use this framework as a pre-audit assessment for many of our clients. This allows clients to know that we are checking for certain instances during the audit process.”</p>
<p>This industry standard seems to be helpful, as an anonymous OpenZeppelin client revealed to Cryptonews that EthTrust is what the company had been lacking in the past. The source said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We failed our previous security audit because we didn&#8217;t have clear guidance on what security requirements we were missing. We feel much more confident going into our next audit after reviewing the EthTrust requirements and implementing them in our codebase.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet Nevile commented that while feedback for the EthTrust standard v1 has been positive, it remains challenging getting developers and organizations to know that such an open standard exists. He also noted that the framework is best suited for newer Ethereum projects. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Projects like Uniswap, Aave and others may look at these specifications and find them to be useful, but for the most part it&#8217;s common knowledge for them. Projects that are just now being developed and going to production on Ethereum will likely find these specifications to be valuable.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the question remains whether or not such an industry standard will help prevent security exploits on Ethereum moving forward. John Wingate, founder and chief executive officer of BankSocial – a financial services company that leverages blockchain technology – told Cryptonews that the changing nature of industry standards is problematic. “Standards are always changing; languages are always depreciating methods, variables, data types, and object types,” he said.</p>
<p>This concern in mind, Nevile shared that version 3 of the EthTrust specification is already in the works. “We are roughly 16 months between publications. I think that 12 to 18 months is a frequent enough revision to ensure that we don’t fall out of date.”</p>
<p>Although this may be, Wingate believes that repeatable, automated testing is the only way to make sure decentralized applications are adhering to best practices that may prevent security exploits. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This means being able to set your platform up to have regular, automated, code testing. When the source code, or compiler is known to have a bug, the automation tool can be updated and then everyone gets the benefit of scanning for the exploits.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Singapore-based Cake Group, the parent company of crypto platform Bake, is winding up its company and has filed for liquidation.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/cake-group-founders-spat-worsens-cofounder-seeks-liquidation-firm">Tech in Asia report</a>, the founder of the crypto investment platform U-Zyn Chua has applied to wind up the Cake Group at a Singapore High Court.</p>
<p>The reasons for the company’s wind up aren’t clear. However, in September, Bake crypto platform, which changed its name from Cake DeFi, announced layoffs, affecting 30% of its workforce.</p>
<p>Bake said at the time that the cuts came as a “result of reorganization brought on by the current bear market and individual performance issues.”</p>
<p>Per the liquidation application, Chua listed himself as the plaintiff and the Cake Group as the defendant.</p>
<p>Winding up of a company in Singapore is a legal process where the court orders to sell company assets to pay debts. The remaining money from the assets collected after settling all debts, is then distributed among the company’s shareholders.</p>
<p>The liquidation claim is being filed under the Singaporean <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp/40-2018/Published/20181107">Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act</a> of 2018, the court filing said.</p>
<p>The court has scheduled a hearing for creditors or opposers of the company winding up, for December 22.</p>
<h2>Cake Group’s Revenue Slump</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Cake Group saw massive growth in 2021 like many <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/defi-guides/">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) platforms. The company released an unaudited financial statement at the time that showed revenue reaching $631 million, year-on-year increase of 1,800%.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Group’s operating income hit $203 million for the year. However, following the massive crash in crypto prices in May 2022, and the prolonged crypto winter, the growth gradually slumped.</p>
<p>Cake Group co-founder Julian Hosp said that the firm’s revenue fell to US$266 million in 2022, and profits dropped to US$23.5 million from US$134 million in 2021.</p>

<p>American banking giant JPMorgan has shed light of optimism in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) sectors.</p>
<p>A JPMorgan report published Thursday revealed notable revival in the DeFi and NFT activity, spurred by an improved crypto markets sentiment. Titled ‘Resurgence in DeFi and NFTs: A Market Shift,’ the study attributes the resurgence to the recent US <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> ETF expectations.</p>
<p>The report stressed DeFi and NFT market recovery, though positive in recent times, are only “tentative signs of revival.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“While there is no doubt that the recent resurgence in DeFi/NFT activity is a positive sign, it is too early to get excited about it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A team of analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, noted that the increase comes nearly after two years of market decline. “Thus, creating some optimism that the worst might be behind us in terms of the medium-term trajectory for DeFi/NFT activity.”</p>
<h2>Increased Trading Activity in Decentralized Exchanges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The analysts further wrote that some DeFi recovery is “natural,” given the rise in trading activity in decentralized exchanges (DEX).</p>
<p>DEXs are rapidly gaining popularity in the crypto world for their emphasis on user control, privacy and security. According to <a href="https://defillama.com/dexs">DefiLlama</a>, trading volume on DEXs rose to $133.1 billion in March 2023, the third straight monthly increase.</p>
<p>Further, liquid staking by Lido has also contributed to the improvement in DeFi since early 2023, the JPMorgan report noted. Lido (LDO) liquid staking solution for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> allows users to earn staking rewards without locking assets.</p>
<p>The analysts also pointed out Ether (ETH), which has underperformed other cryptos, impacting the total value locked (TVL) measurement. This “would mechanically show some revival given the price of several smaller cryptocurrencies has risen by more than ether in recent months,” they added.</p>
<p>However, the emergence of new blockchains, DeFi protocols, and NFT platforms is seen as encouraging, the bank said. Ethereum blockchain still faces issues like “network scalability, low transaction speeds and higher fees,” despite the rise in DeFi.</p>

<p>The anonymous attacker behind the recent $47 million exploit of the decentralized crypto exchange KyberSwap has outlined bold demands in proposed negotiation terms made public on November 30. The self-proclaimed &#8220;Kyber Director&#8221; is seeking complete control of KyberSwap&#8217;s operations and assets to remedy the losses from the November 23 breach.</p>
<h2>Kyber Director Seeks Broad Authority Over KyberSwap Governance and Assets</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0479da9d6a3a29b294d6337630ea0a482e7ec7223f3b6e6d72442f6c450264d4">According to the statement shared via Ethereum transaction</a>, Kyber Director is demanding full executive authority over KyberSwap as a company, including temporary ownership of the governance mechanism to enact protocol changes. The exploiter also called for all documents and data related to KyberSwap&#8217;s structure, finances, and intellectual property to be handed over.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Kybeer hacker is schizo AF holy shit <a href="https://t.co/eV7tgsjx5d">pic.twitter.com/eV7tgsjx5d</a></p>
<p>&mdash; yieldfarming (@delucinator) <a href="https://twitter.com/delucinator/status/1730197546281431194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In addition, Kyber Director requested the surrender of all on-chain and off-chain assets tied to the company, encompassing equity, tokens, partnerships, websites, social channels, and any other properties associated with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-leads-decentralized-exchanges-in-2023-trading-volume-hits-all-time-high.htm">decentralized exchange</a>.</p>
<h2>Employee Benefits and Token Holder Rebates Offered in Return</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In return for meeting these demands by December 10, Kyber Director pledged certain concessions to employees, investors, and liquidity providers of KyberSwap. Executives would receive a buyout at a fair valuation, while other employees could expect doubled salaries under the new leadership.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, token holders would benefit from a full protocol overhaul to improve KyberSwap&#8217;s market standing. The exploiter also promised a 50% rebate on recent losses to liquidity providers stemming from the attack. The deal risks collapse if <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-blockchain-technology-empowers-law-enforcement-crypto-investigations.htm">law enforcement intervenes</a>, however.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kyberswap hacker saw the OpenAI coup and said hold my beer</p>
<p>&mdash; loomdart &#8211; (FTX 2.0 Advocate) (@loomdart) <a href="https://twitter.com/loomdart/status/1730200088985645411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;This is my best offer. This is my only offer. I require my demands to be met by December 10, otherwise, the treaty falls through,&#8221; Kyber Director stated in the negotiations. &#8220;Additionally, should I be contacted by agents from any of the 206 sovereignties, concerning the trades I placed on Kyber, the treaty falls through. In this case, rebates will total to exactly 0.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bold proposal was released after <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/264756/kyberswap-recovers-4-7-million-after-exploit#:~:text=Decentralized%20exchange%20protocol%20KyberSwap%20has,concentrated%20liquidity%20pools%20last%20week.">KyberSwap recovered approximately $4.67 million</a> from frontrunning bots that capitalized on the breach. The decentralized exchange said it continues collaborating with authorities to track down more exploited assets.</p>
<p>While risky, the proposed treaty could mitigate the far-reaching effects of last week’s exploit. Yet handing over full control to the anonymous attacker presents deep governance concerns for a prominent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-lender-exactly-protocol-exploited-for-12-million.htm">DeFi protocol</a>.</p>
<p>KyberSwap now faces a complex decision between recovering additional funds and setting a dangerous precedent of bowing to an exploiter’s demands. With the December 10 deadline looming, the community awaits KyberSwap’s official response to the brazen negotiation attempt.</p>

<p>Neobank <strong>Canza Finance</strong>&#8216;s decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/de-fi-2-0-revolutionizing-socialfi-antivirus-secures-5-million-in-funding.htm">DeFi</a>) tech provides decentralized foreign exchange (FX) for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-matr1x-gaming-platform-raises-10-million-bybits-portfolio-margin-mode-gets-spot-trading-capabilities-mapmetrics-expands-to-peaq-blockchain.htm">African</a> currencies, its CEO and co-founder Pascal Ntsama IV said.</p>
<p>Canza website <a href="https://canza.io/about-us/">stresses</a> that access to financial services and products is &#8220;a massive challenge&#8221; for many millions of individuals globally.</p>
<p>Therefore, the neobank, which enables decentralized cross-border payments, leverages DeFi and digital assets to bridge the existing financial service gap in emerging markets.</p>
<p>Last year, Canza <a href="https://canza.io/2022/10/25/baki-robust-reliable-and-scalable-forex-service/">revealed</a> an addition to its services: <strong>Baki</strong>. It is a liquidity FX exchange for African currencies, aiming to transform African forex &#8220;with transparent currency swaps and zTokens.&#8221;</p>
<p>It said at the time that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The key benefit Baki provides, and central to its architecture, is the ability to offer infinite liquidity at the official conversion rate. This is a significant pain point for any business trying to operate an intra-African trade network.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/africa-foreign-exchange-problems-solved-defi">Talking</a> to <em>Cointelegraph</em>, CEO Ntsama explained that many Africans have trouble accessing forex liquidity and currency swaps. This limits the use of US dollar-based services in the countries dependent on imports &#8211; creating space for DeFi.</p>
<h2>DeFi To The Rescue</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
DeFi &#8211; leveraging cryptocurrencies and blockchain &#8211; can relieve many of the continent&#8217;s pain points.</p>
<p>In the case of Canza, this is where Baki comes in.</p>
<p>When users exchange local fiat currencies, funds exit Africa, which results in dollar value inflation. <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career-map/sell-side/capital-markets/slippage/#:~:text=Slippage%20occurs%20when%20the%20execution,quick%20turns%20in%20certain%20trends.">Currency slippage</a> leads to increased costs. Baki, the CEO says, allows users to trade at official central bank prices and swap currencies without loss.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the agent assumes local currency risk in FX swaps, Baki reduces risks by swapping similar currencies at the official central bank rate, Ntsama said.</p>
<p>This then enables the agent to swap again with the least slippage when entering US dollar positions.</p>
<p>Ntsama also commented on Nigeria where the use of blockchain &#8211; even though approved &#8211; is yet to become widespread. Per the <em>Cointelegraph</em> report, &#8220;Ntsama said Baki is built to work with the current regulatory climate as it leverages existing user behaviors to tackle problems with blockchain technology.&#8221;</p>

<h2>African Hubs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
African countries are increasingly moving towards crypto and blockchain.</p>
<p>Canza, for example, aims to create a hub for businesses to participate in FX trades at a reduced cost.</p>
<p>Per a recent CNBC report, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/billionaire-investor-mike-novogratz-expects-bitcoin-gold-and-silver-to-rally-as-fed-pivots.htm">bitcoin (BTC)</a> is on its way to becoming the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-set-disrupt-africas-85-billion-financial-system-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">currency of choice</a> for moving money between African countries. The report came three months after the inaugural <strong>Africa Bitcoin Conference</strong> in Ghana.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jack-dorseys-block-reports-strong-q3-earnings-profits-from-bitcoin-holdings-surge.htm">Jack Dorsey</a> spoke at the conference about how BTC had made up for money lost during an earlier street protest in Nigeria.</p>

<p>In early February 2023, the <strong>Ministry of Technology and Science</strong> of Zambia <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/zambia-experiments-with-technology-regulate-cryptocurrency-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">announced</a> that it &#8211; through the <strong>Security Exchange Commission</strong> and <strong>Bank of Zambia</strong> &#8211; was testing technology to regulate crypto as the country embarked on its mission to become a regional hub.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cryptocurrency will be a driver for financial inclusion and a change maker for Zambia’s economy,&#8221; Minister Felix Mutati said.</p>
<p>In November, crypto payments giant <strong>Ripple</strong> <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-collaborates-to-power-payments-corridors-between-africa-and-rest-of-the-world.htm">partnered</a> with fintech <strong>Onafriq</strong> to facilitate crypto-enabled cross-border payments between 27 African countries and markets around the world.</p>

<p>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) released new guidance on November 9, stating that capital gains tax (CGT) applies to certain decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions. The tax agency has failed to clarify key aspects of these rules, however, leaving Australian crypto investors confused about how to comply.</p>
<h2>No Straight Answers on Everyday DeFi Taxation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/crypto-asset-investments/decentralised-finance-and-wrapping-crypto">The guidance said</a> CGT is payable when transferring tokens to smart contracts or addresses not owned by the user. This includes activities like staking, lending, and wrapping tokens.</p>
<p>The ATO did not confirm whether everyday DeFi activities like liquid staking Ether through Lido or transferring funds via layer-2 bridges incur CGT, despite direct questions from industry members.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/australia-introduces-capital-gains-tax-for-wrapped-tokens.htm">If CGT does apply to such transactions</a>, it would mean investors owe tax on &#8220;profits&#8221; even if they haven&#8217;t sold their crypto or realized any actual gains. For example, an Australian who bought Ether for $100 and later sent it via a bridge when the price was $1000, would owe tax on $900 of &#8220;profit&#8221; despite still owning the ETH.</p>
<p>ATO simply stated that tax consequences depend on the &#8220;steps taken on the platform&#8221; and users&#8217; specific circumstances, leaving DeFi users unsure of how to abide by the unclear new rules.</p>
<h2>Experts Critique Aggressive Approach to Taxing DeFi</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Industry leaders argue this aggressive approach shows the tax agency&#8217;s lack of understanding of the nuances of DeFi protocols.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The way the ATO rules on wrapped tokens read, it also looks like bridging ETH to a L2 is a CGT event. </p>
<p>In fact, the way most bridges work&#8230;every cross-chain bridge could be considered a CGT event.</p>
<p>You think you&#39;re HODLing and transferring. The ATO thinks you&#39;re disposing and…</p>
<p>&mdash; Crypto Tax Made Easy (@CryptoTaxSucks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoTaxSucks/status/1725353910569971936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;I think they don’t have enough of an understanding about the nature of what these transactions actually are,&#8221; Matt Walrath, founder of Crypto Tax Made Easy, said.</p>
<p>Walrath clarified that staking and lending don&#8217;t transfer beneficial ownership, since users can still withdraw their assets anytime.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the bank might own my house when I mortgage it, I’m still the beneficial owner,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The former <a href="https://taxboard.gov.au/review/digital-assets-transactions-aus">Australian government had tasked the Board of Taxation</a> with developing appropriate crypto tax rules. But these recommendations, already delayed twice, aren&#8217;t expected until February 2023.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is staking tokens a capital gains event in Australia now?!</p>
<p>According to the ATO&#39;s new guidance, it might be. And this is absolutely ridiculous if enforced.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll explain why.</p>

<p>“In the absence of legislation, the ATO has been allowed to make up the rules on their own,” said Senator Andrew Bragg, who criticized the government&#8217;s inaction <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ato-wont-clarify-australia-crypto-tax-rules">in an interview with Cointelegraph</a>.</p>
<p>He said the lack of clear legislation has created &#8220;complexity and uncertainty&#8221; for Australian crypto users.</p>
<p>DeFi users argue that everyday activities like using <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cryptos-liquid-staking-sector-rises-near-record-high-with-15-billion-surge.htm">liquid staking</a> or bridges are essential to gaining the technological benefits of crypto networks. Taxing them discourages the adoption of this technology. They want to see sensible tax policy developed in consultation with industry experts, not blanket rules created in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Experts agree clarity is urgently needed, even if it means paying taxes. They hope to see nuanced legislation soon, developed in collaboration with industry. But until then, Australian DeFi users have no option but to wait or take matters to court themselves.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Aragon DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, has passed two votes that support a lawsuit against its founding team, allocating $300,000 in funding for the legal battle. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The voting process saw unanimous approval for the proposal, with 1.6 million governance tokens cast in favor, according to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://dao.aragon.org/#/voting/0x5b2ae5f9f1870a7d31ab74d3313262b3210c015d/votes/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">voting results</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The second vote regarding funding witnessed 1.6 million tokens in favor and 1 million tokens against.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The decision comes as a response to the Aragon Association&#8217;s move to dissolve itself and discontinue its governance token, ANT, through redemptions for ether. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The association made this decision independently, without consulting the DAO, citing legal constraints as the reason for the move.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The proposed lawsuit intends to challenge the decision made without a vote and raises concerns about the Aragon Association potentially retaining $50 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The proposal aims to hold the responsible members of the Aragon Association accountable to ensure that investor funds are returned and not absorbed by the association&#8217;s new undisclosed company.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To pursue legal action and negotiate with the Aragon team, the DAO has allocated $300,000 in funding to Patagon Management LLC. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Patagon, an investment company owned by Diogenes Casares, has previously taken legal action against Wei &#8220;Max&#8221; Wu in relation to the Spartacus DAO, where token holders felt they suffered losses due to a similar restructuring.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The funding has been transferred to Patagon&#8217;s wallet in the stablecoin USDC. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The proposal also allows other individuals to contribute financially to the lawsuit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the case is won, these contributors will receive their funds back with a 10% annual interest rate and a 5% share of the total funds to be returned to token holders. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, if the case is lost, they will not receive compensation.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">An oversight committee will monitor the progress of the lawsuit.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It consists of representatives from investment firm Arca, crypto trader DCF God, and pseudonymous individuals known as Wismerhill, Tedward, CM, Triangular, and Yakitori.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Aragon Association Claims Majority of ANT Holders Have Redeemed Tokens</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Aragon Association has said that a significant number of Aragon token holders have redeemed their tokens, surpassing the number of tokens used in the voting process. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">They argued that this suggests that the recent vote may not be fully representative of the Aragon community. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Aragon core team clarified that they are not part of the Aragon Association and had no decision-making power in the association&#8217;s dissolution. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth noting that individuals involved in the potential lawsuit against Aragon and serving on the oversight committee have been previously engaged in disputes and dealings with DAOs. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The RFV Raiders, a group of crypto activists, have been associated with efforts to shut down DAOs and distribute their treasuries among token holders.</span></p>

<p>So far, the project has successfully raised $5 million, with the sale still open for users eager to join the 2.0 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Investments can be made either with crypto using BNB, USDT or USDC, or directly with a credit card.</p>

<p>Originating during the so-called “DeFi Summer” of 2020 as a community of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-yield-farming.htm">yield farmers</a>, De.Fi has now evolved, resolving multiple industry challenges and expanding its user base over 100 times in the past three years, according to Michael Rosmer, the project’s co-founder.</p>
<p>De.Fi&#8217;s contributions include defusing over 540,000 risk tokens, potentially saving a staggering $27 billion by identifying scams based on smart code, sometimes before a scam project even goes live.</p>
<p>The project has been supported by HOF Capital, one of the early investors instrumental in the success of Tesla and SpaceX, Rosmer said about his project’s backers in a video on the De.Fi <a href="https://de.fi/2.0">website</a>.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Decentralized exchange dYdX has used its insurance fund to cover losses amounting to $9 million resulting from a &#8220;targeted attack&#8221; against the exchange.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a Saturday post on X (formerly Twitter), the dYdX team said that the v3 insurance fund was deployed &#8220;to address gaps in the liquidation process within the YFI market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The v3 insurance fund remains well funded with $13.5m in funds remaining. No user funds were affected and our team is working to investigate the event,&#8221; they added. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last night about $9m from the dYdX v3 insurance fund were used to fill gaps on liquidations processed in the YFI market. The v3 insurance fund remains well funded with $13.5m in funds remaining</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Likewise, dYdX founder Antonio Juliano confirmed the attack in a post on X, calling the event &#8220;pretty clearly a targeted attack against dYdX.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Yearn.Finance (YFI) token witnessed a 43% drop on November 17th after experiencing a remarkable surge of over 170% in the preceding weeks.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How Did dydx Hackers Pull the Attack?</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The alleged attack specifically targeted long positions in YFI tokens on the exchange, resulting in the liquidation of positions worth nearly $38 million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Juliano suspected that trading losses incurred by dYdX, along with the significant decline in YFI, were the result of market manipulation. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He further announced that a comprehensive review of risk parameters would be conducted, and appropriate modifications would be made to both v3 and potentially the dYdX Chain software if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a first step against a future incident, dYdX increased margin requirements for &#8220;less liquid&#8221; markets including EOS, RUNE, AAVE, and others.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The profitable trade that triggered the attack wiped out over $300 million in market capitalization from the YFI token, raising suspicions within the community about a potential insider job in the YFI market. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some users have claimed that 50% of the YFI token supply is held in 10 wallets controlled by developers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, data from Etherscan suggests that some of these holders are crypto exchange wallets rather than developer-controlled addresses.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The dydx hack comes as hacks and scams continue to plague the crypto industry.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a report by blockchain security platform Immunefi, there were 76 hacks on crypto and Web3 projects and firms in Q3 2023, a significant increase compared to the 30 hacks reported in the same period in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In total, approximately $332 million has been lost to various exploits, hacks, and scams throughout September, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/september-2023-marks-record-high-crypto-exploits-with-329-million-stolen-report.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">marking a record-high month</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for crypto exploits. </span></p>

<p>Decentralized oracle network Chainlink recently awarded white hat hackers Zach Obront and Or Cyngiser of Trust $300,000 for uncovering a critical vulnerability in its Verifiable Random Function (VRF) product. VRF allows smart contracts to access tamper-proof random values while maintaining security.</p>
<p>The bug discovery comes amid <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vodafone-and-chainlink-collaborate-on-blockchain-enabled-proof-of-concept-for-global-trade.htm">Chainlink&#8217;s increased institutional adoption</a> of its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) technology. Major traditional institutions like Swift, Vodafone and South Korea&#8217;s largest gaming company have <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vodafone-and-chainlink-collaborate-on-blockchain-enabled-proof-of-concept-for-global-trade.htm">utilized Chainlink&#8217;s technology in recent months</a>.</p>
<h2>Uncovered Potential for Manipulation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://blog.chain.link/smart-contract-research-case-study/#case_study__immunefi_bug_bounty_report">According to Chainlink Labs</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/zachobront">Obront</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/trust__90/">Cyngiser</a> identified an issue where a malicious VRF subscription owner could potentially prevent users from getting proper randomness rolls by blocking and rerolling until a desired outcome occurred. The team categorized it as a critical smart contract vulnerability.</p>
<p>Although the conditions required to exploit this loophole were specific, it still compromised the core functionality of Chainlink VRF in providing transparent and verifiable on-chain randomness. The primary risk came from a compromised or malicious subscription owner, a role typically controlled by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-build-decentralized-application-dapp.htm">decentralized app</a> using VRF.</p>
<h2>Mitigation Implemented, $300K Bounty Paid</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
After consulting the researchers, Chainlink implemented a fix to guarantee randomness delivery even if the subscription owner tries exploiting the vulnerability. Obront and Cyngiser received $300,000 for responsibly disclosing the issue, positioning the bounty among the <a href="https://immunefi.com/immunefi-top-10/">top 10 payouts in Immunefi&#8217;s history</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><a href="https://hackerone.com/chainlink">Chainlink runs bug bounty programs</a> on HackerOne and Immunefi, awarding security researchers who help identify weaknesses in its systems. The network has paid out over $500,000 to date across 75+ resolved reports.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-staking-crowdsourced-audit/">Crowdsourced audits on Code4rena</a> have also been conducted to further strengthen security. The decentralized platform continues taking steps to secure its reputation for reliability and transparency amid growing adoption.</p>
<h2>Increasing Real-World Use Cases</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chainlink&#8217;s VRF is used by dApps like Axie Infinity, <a href="https://medium.com/pancakeswap/why-were-using-chainlink-vrf-as-a-provably-fair-way-to-draw-lottery-winners-f1da41af125f">PancakeSwap</a>, and Aavegotchi to protect smart contracts. The company&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chainlinks-cross-chain-protocol-goes-live-base-heres-latest.htm">CCIP</a> allows communication between different blockchains, eliminating a major obstacle in decentralized finance. Its adoption by institutional giants like Swift and Vodafone for tokenization indicates growing trust in the technology.</p>
<p>With decentralized finance expanding rapidly, Chainlink&#8217;s security and interoperability solutions are likely to see increased real-world application. Responsible disclosure and mitigation of issues like the recent VRF vulnerability will prove critical for maintaining reliability as use cases scale up.</p>

<p>Following massive pushback from the crypto industry, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) held a public hearing on Monday morning, chiefly discussing their recently proposed digital asset broker reporting regulations.</p>
<h2>A firestorm of comments</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Initially filed on August 29th, 2023, the IRS’ proposed regulations have been at the epicenter of controversy, with nearly 125,000 comments listed on the document as of Monday, November 13th. </p>
<p>Proponents believe the regulatory framework would open the door to accurate accounting and taxation of cryptocurrencies. However, critics argue the proposed regulations would <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-raises-concerns-over-proposed-irs-tax-regulations-crypto.htm">negatively impact the cryptocurrency sector</a> as a whole by threatening consumer privacy and ultimately extending government overreach.</p>
<h2>Over-reporting and overreach</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The proposed regulation has been criticized for its use of the term broker, which includes “a dealer, a barter exchange, and any other person who (for a consideration) regularly acts as a middleman with respect to property or services.” Critics argue that the definition is too vague given the wide variety of entities that could be classified under the same umbrella.</p>
<p>“The Proposed Regulations interpret the term “broker” to include “digital asset middleman,” a vague and expansive category of market participants that bears little resemblance to the persons historically considered brokers,” a comment reads in part from the DeFi Education Fund.</p>
<p>“The IRS is so fixated on retrieving customers’ personally identifiable information (PII) and ensuring taxes are properly reported that is ignoring the costs of over-reporting,” states a comment from American for Tax Reform. “This goes beyond what is required of traditional brokers.”</p>
<h2>&#8220;An existential threat to the future of crypto&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Moreover, players in the crypto space argue that an intermediary is<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-defi.htm"> antithetical to the value of DeFi technology</a>, claiming the absence of a third-party go-between is foundational to the peer-to-peer technology.</p>
<p>“There is no sound reason for Treasury and the IRS to label an imaginary middleman and force that imaginary middleman to report decentralized finance trades and cost-basis tax information,” claims Michael D. Bodman, founder and president of Open Source Ventures. “There is no middleman in decentralized finance protocols, hence the innovation and value of the technology.”</p>
<p>“I stressed my concerns that if approved in its current form, these proposed asset reporting requirements significantly burden growth and innovation in the digital asset sector, and expose consumers to very serious data privacy risks,” tweeted witness and crypto criminal defense attorney, Carlo D’Angelo, of his testimony Monday. “I further stressed that these proposed regulations pose an existential threat to the future of crypto and DeFi in the United States.”</p>
<p>The 1099-DA form is officially <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-holders-face-tricky-tax-situations-as-us-taxes-due-next-week-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">expected to roll out next year</a> and marks the beginning of more robust regulatory oversight of the crypto community. It remains to be seen what, if any, impact the comments will have on the regulatory proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Ritual</strong>, a startup building a decentralized platform for artificial intelligence, has raised <strong>$25 million</strong> in a seed funding round. The funding was led by venture capital firm <strong>Archetype</strong>, with participation from <strong>Robot Ventures</strong> and <strong>Canonical</strong>.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based startup seeks to provide <a href="https://mgiep.unesco.org/article/can-artificial-intelligence-help-us-achieve-universal-quality-education">universal access to AI</a> technology. Currently, innovation and access to high-quality AI like large language models is <strong>concentrated at big tech companies</strong> like Google, Microsoft, and Meta. Ritual wants to change that by building an open, <strong>decentralized network</strong> for hosting, training, and running AI models.</p>
<p>&#8220;The consolidation of AI among a small group of powerful companies poses a significant threat to the future of technology,&#8221; said Niraj Pant, co-founder of Ritual <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/11/08/two-former-polychain-partners-fundraise-25-million-ritual-decentralize-ai/">in a press release</a>. &#8220;We founded Ritual to end the ecosystem&#8217;s reliance on the few, to open access to this critical infrastructure, and ensure a future of building better AI.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Democratizing Access to Cutting-Edge AI</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://ritual.global/">Ritual</a>&#8216;s network connects distributed computing devices to power various AI workloads, allowing anyone to participate in training and running models, not just large tech companies with massive computing resources.</p>
<p><iframe title="Decentralized Artificial Intelligence" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GWOdAAFoSFE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>An <strong>API layer</strong> provides easy access to models hosted on the network. A proof system offers guarantees around <strong>computational integrity</strong>. The <strong>decentralized nature</strong> of Ritual also makes it <strong>resistant to censorship</strong> and provides inherent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/people-want-data-privacy-but-don-t-always-know-what-they-re-8165.htm">data privacy</a> and verifiability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ritual is building the leading decentralized AI network, expanding the potential for every single company &#8211; from crypto to enterprise &#8211; to innovate on this new frontier of technology,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaegan/">Ash Egan</a>, founder of Archetype.</p>
<p>Unique use cases enabled by Ritual&#8217;s decentralized approach include autonomous agents and <a href="https://medium.com/@cryptopromo/potential-impact-of-ai-on-the-defi-space-5e01c7ca53ad#:~:text=Integrating%20AI's%20capabilities%20in%20data,and%20accessible%20decentralized%20financial%20services.">integrating AI with decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) protocols to enable dynamic governance.</p>
<p>The startup claims it&#8217;s the first platform allowing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a> to natively integrate AI capabilities. Enterprises can also leverage the network for <strong>private fine-tuning</strong> and inference with foundation models.</p>
<h2>Strong Team to Realize the Vision</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ritual was founded by Pant, former investor at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nocturne-raises-6m-from-vitalik-buterin-polychain-bankless-bain-capital-crypto-enable-private-accounts-ethereum.htm">Polychain Capital</a>, and <a href="https://www.akilesh.me/">Akilesh Potti</a>, a machine learning researcher turned quant at Palantir.</p>
<p>The 15-person team combines experts from OpenAI, Coinbase, Palantir, and other leading technology companies.</p>
<p>Ritual plans to use the new funding to build out the network, hire key roles, and grow its ecosystem of users. The company is targeting an <strong>alpha launch in early 2024</strong>.</p>
<p>Advisors include AI and crypto experts like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/near-protocol-skyrockets-37-following-crypto-tweet.htm">NEAR Protocol</a> co-founder Illia Polosukhin, EigenLayer founder <a href="https://twitter.com/sreeramkannan">Sreeram Kannan</a>, and Robot Ventures GP <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarunchitra">Tarun Chitra</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ritual is building long-term infrastructure for safe and secure open-source AI innovation across all industries, and has the potential to power the next wave of growth and innovation,&#8221; said Polosukhin.</p>

<p>A trader using the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap V3 lost over $700,000 after he entered wrong values while creating a new liquidity pool.</p>
<p>According to an X post from on-chain analytics firm Arkham, the user added a total of $1.5 million of liquidity in the WBTC-CRV pool he created on Uniswap V3 at a price that was highly inflated compared to the actual market price at the time.</p>
<p>After only 12 seconds, so-called Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots took advantage of the mispricing to swap CRV tokens for much more valuable WBTC tokens.</p>
<p>CRV is the governance token of the Curve decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, while WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) is an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-erc20-wallets.htm">ERC-20 token</a> that represents <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-the-united-states.htm">Bitcoin</a> on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<h2>Only $260 in profit</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Interestingly, the MEV bot that was most successful at arbitraging the mispricing only managed to profit around $260 after having to pay some $527,000 worth of Ether as a firm of bribe to validators to get ahead of other bots.</p>
<p>The incident was likely due to a so-called “fat finger” while entering a trade, or as in this case, setting up a new liquidity pool.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">MEV Bots instantly rushed the pool to swap CRV for valuable WBTC &#8211; with the first bot making off with $1.36M in WBTC for only $730K in CRV.</p>
<p>But the bot only netted ~$260, paying $527K of ETH to the validator just to make this transaction.</p>
<p>Tough luck! <a href="https://t.co/3JbVwhwYoj">pic.twitter.com/3JbVwhwYoj</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1720798847763394848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>One plausible explanation that has emerged is that the user mistook the CRV token for USD while adding $1.56 million worth of WBTC to the pool. The user in return <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa1988ed7ee2bb320bf0da8bc36156bf8b4a941c646d2fad46b6a2377cad7346d">received</a> 1.56 million CRV tokens, which in US dollar terms has a current value of only around $900,000.</p>

<h2>What are MEV bots?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Until recently relatively unknown, Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots have now become an important part of the DeFi ecosystem on the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>The bots are designed to quickly identify and exploit profit opportunities on decentralized exchanges, but they have also been associated with what some would call scams and ethically questionable practices.</p>
<p>Sometimes also referred to as Miner Extractable Value, the bots profit by getting miners (or network validators) to reorder or censor specific transactions within blocks on the blockchain.</p>

Image source: Pixabay</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The UK government has unveiled a comprehensive cryptoasset regulatory framework in response to the end of a consultation period on cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>With these proposals, the UK government is taking significant steps toward its unprecedented goal of encompassing several cryptoasset activities within the regulatory framework of financial services, such as by providing firms dealing directly with UK retail consumers with authorization requirements, regardless of their location.</p>
<p>Treasury Minister Andrew Griffith said in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">UK Treasury’s press release</a> on Monday that the final framework, published following a crypto consultation in February which concluded in April, seeks to help the UK become a “global hub for cryptoasset technologies” while also making the UK a more appealing choice for starting and scaling cryptoasset businesses.</p>
<p>“The proposals plan to create the conditions for cryptoasset service providers to operate and grow in the UK, whilst managing potential consumer and stability risks,” Griffith said.</p>
<h2>Crypto Exchanges Will  Need to Acquire Authorization</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The documentation outlines that firms involved in cryptoasset activities will now require authorization from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. The authorization process will involve <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-exchanges.htm">crypto exchanges</a> establishing specific admission standards and necessitating full disclosures when introducing new assets.</p>
<p>The UK Treasury was assisted by legal and consulting firms, Crypto native firms and FinTechs, industry associations and members of the public and academia during its consultation, with Griffith acknowledging that changes were made after receiving their insight.</p>
<p>“While most aspects of our proposals were well-received by the large majority of respondents, we have modified certain features of our future framework to take onboard the evidence presented,” Griffith said.</p>
<p>The report added that the new proposed regulations will not affect cryptoassets which are specified investments that are already regulated, such as security tokens. The UK Treasury also clarified that activities relating to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/steve-aoki-launches-exclusive-digital-sneakers-as-nfts-on-stepns-move-to-earn-platform.htm">NFTs</a> that are more of a digital collectible or piece of art than a financial service or product will not be subject to financial services regulation.</p>
<h2>Decentralized Finance Escapes The Regulatory Net For Now</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The framework stopped short of introducing regulations for decentralized finance (DeFi), with the report affirming that regulating DeFi would be “premature.”</p>
<p>“In line with consultation responses, HM Treasury recognizes that it would be premature and ineffective for the UK to regulate DeFi activities currently,” the report stated. “Instead, the government will support efforts at the international level through work at both the FSB and standard-setting bodies to inform a future domestic framework.”</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653a82b7e6c968000daa9bdd/Update_on_Plans_for_Regulation_of_Fiat-backed_Stablecoins_13.10.23_FINAL.pdf">separate document</a> detailing the UK government’s plans for the regulation of fiat-backed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/lack-of-global-regulation-and-inconsistencies-could-hinder-stablecoin-cross-border-utility-cpmi-report.htm">stablecoins</a> after its initial consultation in May, the UK Treasury said that it would regulate the use of fiat-backed stablecoins in payment chains, as well as regulate the activities of issuance and custody of fiat-backed stablecoins when issued in or from the UK irrespective of their uses.</p>
<p>The Treasury said that it plans to introduce secondary legislation in early 2024, but that date could change depending on the parliamentary schedule.</p>

<p>As <strong>decentralized finance</strong> (DeFi) continues to plug along in its quest to capture market share, PancakeSwap, one of the <strong>leading decentralized exchanges</strong>, has recently taken a step toward optimizing its service offerings. On Monday, <a href="https://blog.pancakeswap.finance/articles/experience-single-token-liquidity-provisioning-with-bril-finance-using-pancakeswap-position-manager">PancakeSwap announced a collaboration with DeFi protocol Bril Finance</a>, introducing a <strong>portfolio manager function</strong>.</p>
<p>This feature seeks to augment the financial strategies of PancakeSwap users by <strong>diversifying their investments</strong> into various liquidity pools.</p>
<p>The addition of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spanish-police-save-kidnapped-crypto-portfolio-manager-from-gunpoint-ordeal.htm">portfolio manager</a> allows users to <strong>deposit single assets</strong> into vaults. From there, the assets are automatically distributed to different <strong>liquidity pools</strong>, providing an enhanced <strong>risk-adjusted return</strong> on investments. With cryptocurrencies like USDT, BTC, BNB, and Ether eligible for deposits, this development could lead to a transition in how users manage their crypto portfolios on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-leads-decentralized-exchanges-in-2023-trading-volume-hits-all-time-high.htm">decentralized exchanges</a>.</p>
<h2>A Mechanism for Optimized Returns</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://medium.com/@bril-finance/bril-finance-partners-with-pancakeswap-to-bring-its-high-yield-automated-portfolio-management-tool-11e32db55130">According to the announcement</a>, the portfolio manager deploys an <strong>automatic liquidity provision algorithm</strong> with rebalancing features. The collaboration between PancakeSwap and Bril Finance simplifies the <strong>asset management process</strong> for users. Initial tests claim that this system has already yielded an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp#:~:text=The%20internal%20rate%20of%20return,a%20discounted%20cash%20flow%20analysis.">internal rate of return</a> (IRR) of <strong>over 24%</strong>, a metric that gauges the compound annual growth rate of an investment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_123448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123448" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-123448 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698687782-0_rukq7dm3ugxvlynh.webp" alt="PancakeSwap Bril Portfolio Manager" width="720" height="388" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698687782-0_rukq7dm3ugxvlynh.webp 720w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698687782-0_rukq7dm3ugxvlynh-300x162.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-123448" class="wp-caption-text">PancakeSwap Bril Portfolio Manager, <em><a href="https://medium.com/@bril-finance/bril-finance-partners-with-pancakeswap-to-bring-its-high-yield-automated-portfolio-management-tool-11e32db55130">Medium</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the first four weeks following the feature&#8217;s rollout, users will be eligible for additional rewards in the form of <a href="https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/governance-and-tokenomics">PancakeSwap’s governance token</a>, CAKE. PancakeSwap will initially be the sole platform offering access to <strong>Bril&#8217;s portfolio management system</strong>. This exclusivity highlights PancakeSwap&#8217;s dominance in the DeFi exchange space and its focus on diversifying and enriching its financial product suite.</p>
<h2>Broader Implications for Decentralized Exchanges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
&#8220;We aim to become a hub for all of DeFi and integrations such as this, allowing us to become a one-stop shop for portfolio management,&#8221; said <strong>PancakeSwap&#8217;s CEO</strong>, <a href="https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/team/the-kitchen-team">colloquially known as the Head Chef.</a> &#8220;Bril&#8217;s automated technology and its integration with PancakeSwap will allow PancakeSwap users to enjoy the core features and functionalities they are already accustomed to and seamlessly earn on their assets in a hands-off manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/uniswap-vs-pancakeswap">PancakeSwap is the second-largest decentralized exchange</a> in terms of daily volume, this new feature can be seen as a concerted effort to <strong>fortify its market position</strong>. The integration of Bril&#8217;s portfolio manager is a strategic move in advancing not just PancakeSwap, but potentially setting a <strong>precedent for other decentralized exchanges</strong>.</p>
<p>The integration of a portfolio manager function by PancakeSwap, in collaboration with Bril Finance, represents a strategic shift in how decentralized exchanges are adapting to the evolving needs of their user base. This update not only seeks to optimize returns for individual investors but also underlines the growing sophistication of financial tools available in the DeFi sector.</p>
