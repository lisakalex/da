<p>GambleFi markets are alive with excitement this morning, ahead of the highly-anticipated DEX launch of $TGC token later today, in a major development for the World’s #1 fully-licensed Casino exclusively on Telegram.</p>
<p>$TGC token will <b>launch</b> on <b>DEX markets</b> at <b>6PM UTC </b>on<b> January 4</b> (7PM CET / 1PM EST / 10AM PST) &#8211; at which point the $TGC will be <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x85aa97537837514a9229fcaeb66eeef7242122bf">available to buy</a>.</p>
<p>This comes after the break-out of the <a href="https://tg.casino/">TG.Casino presale</a>, which unlocked sell-out success, as the presale skyrocketed to $5,000,000 raised (representing 100% of the fundraising goal).</p>
<p>With liquidity now added to the TGC/WETH trading pair on DEXtools (<a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x85aa97537837514a9229fcaeb66eeef7242122bf">viewable here</a>), the TG.Casino have bolstered optimism for the year ahead with a 12-month liquidity lock guarantee. </p>

<h2><b>Here’s Why The TG.Casino DEX Launch Could See $TGC Price Skyrocket</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147372" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704381137-f_gs-zdxaaablj4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704381137-f_gs-zdxaaablj4.jpg 1000w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704381137-f_gs-zdxaaablj4-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704381137-f_gs-zdxaaablj4-768x461.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704381137-f_gs-zdxaaablj4-150x90.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With the casino announcing today they’ve surpassed the significant $100m wagering milestone 2-months earlier than expected, $TGC holders are very excited about what the future can bring. </p>
<p>This is because a percentage of casino profits are used to provide passive income through staking, alongside a novel burn mechanism which acts to lower the $TGC token circulating supply. </p>
<p>Top analysts are predicting that the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tg-casino/">$TGC token</a> DEX launch could trigger a sensational pump due to a confluence of tokenomic factors that have heightened market excitement.</p>
<p>A key factor in this is the huge swathe of $TGC currently locked in staking, with a whopping <b>74.78% of $TGC supply staked</b> for an alluring <b>130.54% APY</b> &#8211; reducing the overhead risk of a sudden sell-off dump upon launch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147373" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704381164-screenshot-199.png" alt="" width="1920" height="355" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704381164-screenshot-199.png 1920w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704381164-screenshot-199-300x55.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704381164-screenshot-199-1024x189.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704381164-screenshot-199-768x142.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704381164-screenshot-199-1536x284.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704381164-screenshot-199-150x28.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>This leaves early-bird traders the opportunity to accrue serious immediate gains, with trading launching against a tiny <b>10% circulating supply</b> &#8211; tokenomic conditions that could fuel a seismic price move later today.</p>
<p>With 10-days until any scheduled unlocks, analysts are predicting $TGC could explode to be Hot #1 on DEXtools after launch &#8211; marking TG.Casino as a must-watch token.</p>

<p>And this is without considering the long-term growth potential of the most exciting GambleFi token launch of 2024, due to the rising interest in crypto casinos &#8211; which has seen GambleFi token defy bear market conditions to accelerate up to $700m individual market caps (RLB).</p>
<p>This increase is also spotlighted by surging participation across the market, which according to<a href="https://dune.com/cryptokoryo/gamblefi"> Dune</a>, has seen Cumulative Unique Users of Ethereum-based GambleFi platforms soar from 5,000 at the start of the year to 70,000 by December 2023. </p>
<p>Indeed, Q3-Q4 2023 saw an explosion of interest in the GambleFi vertical, with comparable leading Gambling token <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rollbit-coin/">Rollbit (RLB)</a> surging +5,343% YTD.</p>
<p>While second-largest,<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/funtoken/"> FUNtoken (FUN)</a> posted a +160% intra-day pump in December, as traders rushed into the promise of GambleFi specific layer-2 scaling for Web3.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147369" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704380837-rlb_1y_graph_coinmarketcap.jpg" alt="" width="919" height="512" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704380837-rlb_1y_graph_coinmarketcap.jpg 919w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704380837-rlb_1y_graph_coinmarketcap-300x167.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704380837-rlb_1y_graph_coinmarketcap-768x428.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704380837-rlb_1y_graph_coinmarketcap-150x84.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: right">(RLB &#8211; Blue, FUN &#8211; Orange)</p>
<p>Amid a 32.6% <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/view/gambling/">surge in trading volume</a> across the vertical, traders are clearly gravitating to the market potential in GambleFi in anticipation of moon-shot price action in 2024.</p>
<p>This leaves $TGC poised as the perfect early-entry opportunity for GambelFi FOMO &#8211; positioning the project for major growth in coming months.</p>
<h2><b>What Has Crypto Markets So Hyped About Telegram-Exclusive TG.Casino?</b></h2>

<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Bitget went forward with key investments amid the digital asset winter setting the tone for favourable market conditions in the future. </p>
<p>In a Jan 4 <a href="https://x.com/wublockchain/status/1742854762960421022?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">interview with Colin Wu</a>, the Bitget executive explained the role the exchange took in the bear market, its expansion strategy, achievements, coin listings, and a pathway towards 2024. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gracy Chen Explains Bitget: Why Adopt Aggressive Strategies in a Bear Market? The Direction for 2024? What is the Rumored &quot;Wolf Culture&quot;?<a href="https://t.co/KWkF804BLy">https://t.co/KWkF804BLy</a> <a href="https://t.co/cKtijZjW28">pic.twitter.com/cKtijZjW28</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1742854762960421022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Chen explained that the company kicked off operations five years ago but began gaining rapid traction in the last two years witnessing both bear and bull markets. </p>
<p>The previous <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chainalysis-lays-off-another-150-employees-amid-ongoing-market-downturn.htm">bear market</a> preceding 2020 taught the firm a lot that saw it handle the 2022 season better making strategic partnerships striving towards international expansion in a competitive market. </p>
<p>According to the executive, those who believe in the growth of the sector make investments during the bear market. The firm acquired assets at low prices, onboarded staff while competitors saw walkouts, and most importantly, invested in web3 projects to shape the industry and increase decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-news/">DeFi</a>) numbers. </p>
<p><i>“</i><i>Assets are cheaper, and the talents who truly stay in the industry are the real believers. Therefore, it’s more appropriate to lay out during a bear market. We’ve been through cycles of bull and bear alternation, so we have a deeper understanding and thorough knowledge of these situations.”</i></p>
<p>Chen also disclosed the company’s coin listing strategy as a blend of speed and quality to improve user experience. An example was the ARB token and other projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem including GMX as the exchange responds to market hotspots. </p>
<p>The firm seeks the perfect balance for market trends and user experience creating a fast and responsible platform. </p>
<h2>Regulatory framework toward 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitgets-gracy-chen-on-2024-crypto-market-trends-and-potential-supercycle.htm">recent interview with Cryptonews</a>, Chen highlighted market milestones, regulatory developments, and global expansion strategies in the wake of institutional inflows in the market. </p>
<p>She hailed the recent regulatory milestone hit by countries in the Middle East and North African region as well as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-to-become-the-next-crypto-etf-hub-as-btc-etf-anticipation-continues-in-us.htm">Hong Kong</a> with regulators opening up new hubs and issuing licenses to firms within local frameworks. </p>
<p>However, the United States remains an uncertain space in terms of regulation although investors have high hopes for space. </p>
<p>Still, on regulations, Chen views the latest settlement with Binance and the Department of Justice (DOJ) as taking the issue of compliance to the next level.

<h2>CEO of Collapsed Crypto Fund HyperVerse Seems to Not Exist At All</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The man introduced as the chief executive officer of <strong>HyperVerse</strong>, Steven Reece Lewis, appears not to exist – at least not as the man with a long and impressive list of credentials the company cited. No organization on that list could find any record of him, the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/04/chief-executive-of-collapsed-crypto-fund-hyperverse-does-not-appear-to-exist">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Last month’s Guardian Australia investigation found that thousands of people lost millions of dollars to the <strong>HyperVerse</strong> crypto scheme, linked to a previous scheme called <strong>HyperFund</strong>, under the umbrella organization the <strong>HyperTech</strong> group.</p>
<p>The Australian entrepreneur Sam Lee and his business partner Ryan Xu promoted the company. The duo were the founders of the collapsed Australian bitcoin company <strong>Blockchain Global</strong>.</p>
<p>Per the Guardian, Lee has denied both HyperVerse was a scam and being its founder. Xu could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a man named Steven Reece Lewis was introduced as the HyperVerse CEO at an online global launch event in December 2021. The introduction featured video messages of support from celebrities, including the <strong>Apple</strong> co-founder Steve Wozniak and actor Chuck Norris.</p>
<p>Promotional materials and career summaries said Reece Lewis was a graduate of the <strong>University of Leeds</strong> and held a master’s degree from the <strong>University of Cambridge</strong>, that he had worked for <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, sold a web development company to <strong>Adobe</strong>, and launched an IT start-up firm.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Reece Lewis’s identity could not be verified by the Guardian, nor could he be contacted for comment.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Guardian Australia contacted all the above-cited institutions and has confirmed that none has any record of someone by that name on their databases.</p>
<p>Reece Lewis also had no internet presence other than HyperVerse promotional material. A <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenr_lewis?lang=en">Twitter account</a> was set up a month before his December 2021 introduction. It was active only until June 2022.</p>
<h2>Klaytn Launches the First Gold RWA DeFi Platform Outside Ethereum</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <strong>Klaytn Foundation</strong>, established to build and decentralize the ecosystem of Layer 1 blockchain <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-november-21-radix-klaytn-apecoin.htm">Klaytn</a></strong>, announced that the <strong>Klaytn Governance Council</strong> (GC) member CREDER has launched <strong>GPC</strong> (Gold-Pegged Coin), a digital asset pegged to the real-time market price of gold, and <strong>Goldstation</strong>, a decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/varas-new-leadership-in-dubai-marks-next-phase-of-crypto-regulation.htm">DeFi</a>) platform for GPC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/klaytn-onboards-goldstation-and-gpc-launching-the-first-gold-rwa-defi-platform-outside-of-ethereum-302024388.html">Per</a> the press release, GPC marks two firsts in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization industry. It is the first tokenized gold available on DeFi outside the <strong>Ethereum</strong> ecosystem and the first gold-pegged token that does not charge a percentage-based commission for transactions.</p>
<p>Goldstation is also the first gold RWA token DeFi platform powered by a public mainnet other than Ethereum.</p>
<p>It will commence its services on January 24. While currently only available for South Korean residents, Goldstation plans a global launch in the future.</p>
<h2>Wirex Reveals Strategy to Tackle Dark Web and Mule Account Risks</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Crypto payments platform <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/wirex-unveils-zero-knowledge-proof-based-non-custodial-crypto-debit-card-service.htm">Wirex</a></strong> announced an enhancement in its measures to combat Dark Web activities and money mule threats.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/wirex-launches-innovative-strategy-to-tackle-dark-web-and-mule-account-risks-302024835.html">According</a> to the press release, the company has incorporated US-based cybersecurity company <strong>ZeroFox&#8217;s</strong> Dark Web Monitoring tool into its system, creating a unified solution.</p>
<p>This way, a combination of human and artificial intelligence (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/square-enix-in-2024-doubling-down-on-blockchain-ai-and-metaverse-technologies.htm">AI</a>) actively scans the Dark Web for potential dangers in real time. This includes leaked data, compromised credentials, and other sensitive information.</p>
<p>This is a proactive approach that allows for early detection and prompt intervention.</p>
<p>“Wirex benefits from ZeroFox&#8217;s advanced monitoring capabilities, utilising a sophisticated system that issues detailed alerts about potential threats, including their severity and escalation status, ensuring a quick and effective response to incidents,” the company said.</p>
<h2>KuCoin Labs Announces Its Strategic Investment in ISSP</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kucoin-labs-invests-in-btc-layer-2-dovi-to-advance-bitcoin-ecosystem-development.htm">KuCoin Labs</a></strong>, the investment and incubation arm of the crypto exchange <strong>KuCoin</strong>, has announced its investment in <strong>ISSP</strong>. The latter is the first cross-chain inscription protocol system on the <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-january-2-mina-protocol-sei-sui.htm">Sui</a></strong> network known for its high throughput and scalability.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240102622781/en/KuCoin-Labs-Announces-Its-Strategic-Investment-in-ISSP-the-First-Cross-chain-Inscription-Protocol-on-Sui-to-Advance-Users%E2%80%99-Inscription-Experience">According</a> to the press release, this investment is aimed at supporting the development of ISSP’s inscription protocol.</p>
<p>More than a financial venture, it added, the investment is a strategic step towards fostering innovative solutions in the blockchain sector.</p>
<p>“The focus on ISSP’s inscription protocol marks a new era in blockchain technology, paving the way for more secure, efficient, and scalable blockchain applications. Both KuCoin Labs and ISSP are dedicated to pushing the envelope in blockchain technology, aiming to make a significant impact in the industry,” the teams added.</p>

<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has unveiled progress in the development of the digital euro, with the publication of a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/news/html/ecb.mipnews240103_2.en.html">report</a> detailing the advancements made by the digital euro scheme&#8217;s Rulebook Development Group (RDG).</p>
<p>The update follows a June 2023 report from the same group, and highlights the completion of the initial chapters of the digital euro rulebook, aligning with legislative proposals and design decisions greenlit by the ECB&#8217;s Governing Council.</p>
<p>The first draft of the rulebook serves as an intermediate version, encompassing functional and operational models, technical scheme requirements, and the adherence model, which outlines the rights and obligations of scheme members based on the draft legislation.</p>
<p>According to the report, the first complete rulebook draft with all chapters included will be prepared during the ongoing digital euro “preparation phase.”</p>
<p>RDG members, representing consumers, retailers, and intermediaries, collaborated over the past months to develop these chapters, emphasizing inclusivity and diverse perspectives, the ECB said.</p>
<h2>Opportunity for stakeholders to give feedback</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The rulebook draft is currently undergoing an interim review, providing stakeholders with the opportunity to scrutinize and offer feedback on its current state.</p>
<p>The RDG will consider making adjustments based on received feedback, with a goal of ensuring a comprehensive and adaptable regulatory framework.</p>
<p>According to the ECB, flexibility is a key feature of the draft rulebook, ensuring it is capable of accommodating future adjustments aligned with the digital euro legislative process.</p>
<p>In the preparation phase, the RDG will intensify efforts to finalize the rulebook, introducing additional sections on user experience requirements, branding and communication standards, certification processes, testing and approval procedures, internal rules, risk management, and interoperability and implementation specifications, the ECB statement said.</p>
<h2>Still no formal decision on euro CBDC</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The ECB has not yet made a final decision on whether or not a digital euro will be launched, but ECB President Christine Lagarde is known as a strong proponent of a European central bank digital currency (CBDC), as well as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/european-central-bank-president-christine-lagarde-calls-for-crypto-regulation-eu-following-ftx-collapse-says-it-very-much-needed.htm">critic of private cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>
<p>Among other things, the ECB President has claimed that her <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ecb-president-christine-lagarde-says-her-son-lost-almost-all-money-he-invested-in-crypto.htm">son lost “almost all” the money he invested in crypto</a>.</p>
<p>In September last year, Lagarde <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ecb-chief-lagarde-says-digital-euro-not-yet-out-there-would-take-two-years.htm">said that a digital Euro pilot</a> “will probably take us another two years, at least, before it’s the final say.”</p>
<p>At the time, she also said that a euro CBDC will not eradicate cash, nor substitute it.</p>
<p>“If it can be user friendly, if it can be free, if it can be a universal digital mode of payment throughout the entire Euro system, I think it will have checked many of the boxes, which I believe would characterize it as success,” she noted.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the past 24-hours more than 150,000,000 LUNC has been burned, however, the downtick in price comes amid increased woes for Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon &#8211; who last week saw a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terraform-labs-ceo-do-kwon-violated-us-securities-law-says-judge.htm">Judge rule in agreement</a> with the Securities and Exchanges Commission that Kwon violated the law.</p>
<h2><strong>LUNC Price Analysis: As LUNC Hammers Down Is Terra Luna Classic Going to Zero?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With price action hammering the bottom of the channel, Terra Luna Classic is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/LUNCUSDT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.00011741</a> (representing a 24-hour change of 0.64%).</p>
<p>This comes as price retraces from upper trendline resistance at $0.00027960, in a month-long bleed-out that has seen price tumble a worrying -64%, leaving price action perilously on the edge of slipping back into rock-bottom price levels.</p>
<p>Moving averages have played a significant role in the downside price action over the past fortnight, with LUNC losing supportive footing from the 20DMA on December 15.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147324" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375360-thumbnail_luncusdt_2024-01-04_13-11-26.png" alt="LUNC" width="1634" height="891" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375360-thumbnail_luncusdt_2024-01-04_13-11-26.png 1634w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375360-thumbnail_luncusdt_2024-01-04_13-11-26-300x164.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375360-thumbnail_luncusdt_2024-01-04_13-11-26-1024x558.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375360-thumbnail_luncusdt_2024-01-04_13-11-26-768x419.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375360-thumbnail_luncusdt_2024-01-04_13-11-26-1536x838.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375360-thumbnail_luncusdt_2024-01-04_13-11-26-150x82.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1634px) 100vw, 1634px" /></p>
<p>This has seen the 20DMA (now sat at $0.00014990) flip to resistance, forcing a descendant capstone that has pushed price downwards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 200DMA is still reflecting the recent uptick recovery, showing continual but gradual ascendance at $0.00008945.</p>
<p>A crucial local support at $0.00011525 now stands as the last hope of desperate LUNC holders, who fear a return to capitulation.</p>
<p>Yet, a glimmer of hope emerges from the RSI, which has cooled down significantly over the retracement move, now showing serious oversold bullish divergence at 35.31 &#8211; suggesting price could soon resume upside movements.</p>
<p>But this is contrasted with negative sentiment from the MACD which is displaying bearish divergence at -0.00000523 &#8211; highlighting the fleeting momentum.</p>
<p>Overall, Terra Luna Classic looks weak here, with rally structure on the verge of collapse amid awful project fundamentals following the Do Kwon court ruling.</p>

<p>To the upside this leaves LUNC targeting a recovery to higher support above $0.00013525 (a possible +15.84%).</p>
<p>While downside risk could see LUNC plummet down to lower price range at $0.0000805 (a potential -31%).</p>
<p>This leaves Terra Luna Classic facing a risk: reward ratio of 0.51 &#8211; suggesting a weak entry dominated by downside risk.</p>
<p>But while LUNC offers an unappealing entry, a rapidly growing Bitcoin Cloud Mining project is emerging as a potential breakout Bitcoin halving play.</p>

<p>With the Bitcoin Minetrix approach, gone are the days of heavy initial capital and navigating complex mining contracts.</p>
<h2><strong>$8M In The Crosshairs: Bitcoin Minetrix Surges Past $7.46M As Markets Rush To Bitcoin Cloud Mining</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Since the 2021 Bull Run, Bitcoin mining has defied expectations by undertaking something of a renaissance in network growth.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate">Hash Rate</a> (a measure of the total amount of computational power directed at mining Bitcoin blocks) has surged to an incredible all-time high of 525 Exahashes per second (EH/S).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147330" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375591-1703848175-hash-rate-2.png" alt="" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375591-1703848175-hash-rate-2.png 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375591-1703848175-hash-rate-2-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375591-1703848175-hash-rate-2-1024x512.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375591-1703848175-hash-rate-2-768x384.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704375591-1703848175-hash-rate-2-150x75.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>This dramatic growth has been fuelled by a substantial increase in the scale of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms’ mining operations.</p>
<p>The world’s largest Bitcoin miner – Marathon – <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1333/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-third-quarter-2023-results">reported that for Q3 2023</a> it had an average hash rate of 14.2 EH/s (a 500% growth YoY), around 4% of the overall network hash (mining around 1153 BTC per month, or, $42.2M USD).</p>
<p>Meanwhile Riot Platforms reported <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/riot-platforms-reports-third-quarter-2023-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-highlights/">a new record hash rate of 10.9 EH/s</a> (mining around 368 BTC per month, or, $13.3M USD), with Riot’s operations expected to grow to 20.2 EH/s by summer 2024.</p>
<p>But while the all-time high in Bitcoin network hash rate is healthy for Bitcoin network security, and clearly profitable for growing mining operations, it has also begun to lose sight of the original promise of Satoshi Nakamoto’s decentralization.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining in 2023 is the most centralized it has ever been in its short 15-year history.</p>
<p>A closer look at the summary of mined blocks over the past 48-hours reveals that a shocking <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools">55.79%</a> of all Bitcoin block rewards go to just two Bitcoin mining pools.</p>
<p>AntPool took the largest share at 83 blocks mined (29.123%), while second largest mining pool Foundry USA mined 76 blocks (26.667%).</p>
<p>This dwarfs the number of blocks mined by even third place F2Pool (34 blocks mined, around 11.93%), highlighting the growing challenge of increased mining centralization.m</p>
<p>This heightened network activity, and increased centralization of mining power has become clearly reflected in the consequent all-time high in the difficulty rate for mining Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Currently standing at 62,573,539,549,305 – it has never been harder for the individual participant to engage in profitable Bitcoin mining.</p>

<p>This challenge of heightened network difficulty, fuelled by increased competition and centralization of mining power, has created the need for new solutions for the retail investor to participate in Bitcoin mining – both for network decentralization and preserving Bitcoin as a profitable activity for the individual.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On January 4, the blockchain investigator <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1742753372334399513">PeckShield</a> detected an exploit linked to Gamma Strategies with an estimated value of approximately $469,000.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the DeFi platform confirmed a &#8220;possible security incident&#8221; but reassured users that fund withdrawals remained possible. The protocol is investigating the incident, and it has promised to provide further details once the investigation is complete.</p>
<p>In response to the ongoing incident, Gamma Strategies has taken immediate action to prevent further losses. The team has disabled deposits in all public DeFi vaults while ensuring that withdrawals remain active for users who need to access their funds.</p>
<p>Despite the incident, the protocol&#8217;s vaults will continue to be managed normally for the time being. However, deposits have been temporarily shut down until the team identifies and mitigates the problem.</p>
<p>However, analysts from the security firm BlockSec <a href="https://x.com/Phalcon_xyz/status/1742781426926227463?s=20">reported</a> a critical vulnerability in the protocol&#8217;s accounting mechanism, specifically citing an inconsistency between the accounting mechanisms used by Gamma Strategies for depositing and withdrawing.</p>
<p>This inconsistency results in a discrepancy between liquidity and shares, allowing the attacker to withdraw an excessive amount of tokens.</p>
<p>Additionally, during the confusion surrounding the security incident, a fake verified Twitter account impersonating Gamma&#8217;s social media presence was discovered. This fake account attempted to redirect actual investors to a phishing website, urging users to &#8220;revoke all approvals to prevent loss of funds.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Mixin platform experienced a significant blow in September, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/breaking-mixin-networks-cloud-service-provider-hacked-200-million-funds-affected.htm">losing $200 million</a>, and was unable to locate the attacker or retrieve the funds. However, Mixin committed to compensating users for half of their lost holdings.</p>
<p>Other notable breaches included a security incident at the popular crypto exchange Poloniex in November, initially reported at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-security-firm-peckshield-reports-suspicious-activity-in-poloniex-exchange-wallet-60-million-drained.htm">$33 million and later adjusted to over $120 million</a>. The crypto gambling platform Stake also faced a $41 million theft in September.</p>
<p>However, KyberSwap, another crypto firm, reported a revenue loss of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kyberswap-hacked-for-48-million-hackers-suggest-negotiations.htm">$49 million</a> resulting from an exploit and, as a result, is planning to downsize its team by half to sustain the company&#8217;s day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>As part of the efforts to mitigate the financial impact of the exploit, Kyber Network&#8217;s CEO, Victor Tran, announced a temporary pause on the liquidity protocol initiatives and the KyberAI project. While these initiatives have been temporarily suspended, the core business functions of KyberSwap, such as its Aggregator and Limit Order features, remain operational.</p>

<p>Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) generated massive gains for investors that bought early on before they skyrocketed in value. While ADA and SHIB have had decent performances to end 2023, they do not offer the same parabolic potential they once did for early investors. Meanwhile, promising projects in their presale phase like <a href="https://pushd.store/">Pushd</a> (PUSHD), still do. Like Cardano and Shiba Inu early on, Pushd is gaining serious traction as one of the top investment opportunities of 2024.</p>
<p><b>Cardano (ADA) Entering 2024 on a High Note</b></p>
<p>Cardano finished Q4 2023 on a wave of positive momentum, with the broader crypto market sentiment turning bullish. With this came increased investor interest and confidence in Cardano, making its ADA token well-positioned for further growth in 2024. One catalyst for Cardano in 2024 is its partnerships. Most recently, Cardano has partnered with Brazil state-owned energy supplier Petrobras to provide blockchain education. Through the partnership, Petrobras is expected to explore the possibility of implementing Cardano in its multi-billion dollar business.</p>
<p><b>Shiba Inu (SHIB) Maintains Top-Tier Status as Ecosystem Grows</b></p>
<p>Meme coins come and go, but Shiba Inu has managed to stay and maintain its status as a top-20 cryptocurrency. It’s the second-largest meme coin, second only to Dogecoin. With Shiba Inu’s expanding ecosystem and devoted community, SHIB is on plenty of shortlists as one of the cryptos to gain in 2024. Its Layer-2 scalability solution Shibarium celebrated a milestone of over 150 million transactions in 2023, indicating the growing adoption of the Shiba Inu ecosystem by more and more individuals. This could foreshadow a resurgent 2024 for Shiba Inu holders.</p>
<p><b>Pushd (PUSHD) Ready for Takeoff As Presale Draws Over 3,000 Registrants Within 48 Hours</b></p>
<p><a href="https://pushd.store/">Pushd</a> is primed for a big 2024 with the launch of its much-anticipated $PUSHD token presale. The event has already garnered over 3,000 registered sign ups to its presale platform within 48 hours of its announcement. Pushd will build the first decentralized online marketplace to go toe-to-toe against Amazon or Ebay. The Web3-enabled ecommerce platform will feature 0 listing fees, minimal KYC procedures, and the ability to generate alternative income streams using the (PUSHD) token. (PUSHD) entitles holders to earn passive income through revenue sharing on platform costs traders incur on the platform.</p>
<p>With the Bitcoin halving event just around the corner—and with it, the promise of a potential bull run—<a href="https://pushd.store/">Pushd</a> is perfectly positioned to reap the benefits with a potential 25x to 50x increase up its sleeve. (PUSHD) tokens are currently available at discounted prices of $0.035; now is the perfect time to join the presale and accumulate Pushd tokens before they list and launch for public sale on major exchanges.</p>
<p><b>Don’t Miss Out on the Top Presale Opportunity of 2024</b></p>
<p>Crypto presales are the best opportunities to make life-changing gains. If you’ve missed out on Cardano and Shiba Inu, don’t despair—(PUSHD) might be the perfect way to diversify your crypto portfolio with a potential blue chip in 2024.</p>

<p>OPSEC token is <a href="https://twitter.com/OpSecCloud">growing on the promise</a> of fortifying cloud security with decentralized servers; with the OPSEC coin acting as a means of settlement for RDPs, GPUs, private servers and networks.</p>
<h2><strong>OPSEC Price Analysis: Is OPSEC Set For Major Breakout Amid Storage Token Narrative?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As price action mounts a well-defended consolidation, OPSEC token is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0x515d459555f8c1fcf2791ded819b73b60a80b8e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.03133</a> (representing a 24-hour change of +21.72%).</p>
<p>This comes just days after OPSEC&#8217;s skyrocket launch, which saw OPSEC price explode at midnight on January 3, in a huge +23,325% move across 3-hours that left price in strong rally form.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-147293" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704371421-opsec_usd-uni-dextools-io_2024-01-04_12-11-12.png" alt="OPSEC Coin" width="1478" height="631" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704371421-opsec_usd-uni-dextools-io_2024-01-04_12-11-12.png 1478w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704371421-opsec_usd-uni-dextools-io_2024-01-04_12-11-12-300x128.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704371421-opsec_usd-uni-dextools-io_2024-01-04_12-11-12-1024x437.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704371421-opsec_usd-uni-dextools-io_2024-01-04_12-11-12-768x328.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704371421-opsec_usd-uni-dextools-io_2024-01-04_12-11-12-150x64.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1478px) 100vw, 1478px" /></p>
<p>The promising open has fuelled aggressive accumulation by bag-holders, with 695 holders driving price up to an all-time high of $0.04777 just 24-hour after launch on January 4.</p>
<p>Now trading firmly above a major support level at $0.026, which was established across 2-days of consolidation &#8211; prominent traders are calling for a bounce amid sustained fundamentals and structure.</p>
<p>Indeed, buy pressure remains holding strong, with buy transactions currently representing 58% of trades over the past 6 hours.</p>
<p>This has left OPSEC coin stood at an impressive early-stage market cap of $3.13m &#8211; suggesting a bullish outlook is dominating trader sentiment.</p>
<p>But while OPSEC is stabilizing, this high market cap could see growth slow in coming days, leaving some traders searching for early-bird alternatives such as the unlisted Meme Kombat presale.</p>

<p>With a sturdy promise of Season 1 showcasing 11 distinct meme characters, there’s no shortage of action, and Season 2 is already on the horizon for December 2023.</p>
<p>The decentralized nature of the project, combined with the thrill of AI-driven battles, ensures that the outcomes are both transparent and unpredictable – every battle is a new experience, ensuring players stay engaged.</p>
<h2>Meme Kombat Pits Leading Crypto Meme Communities in High Octane Staking Battles</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The project isn’t just about excitement; it’s built on a foundation of trust – Meme Kombat’s commitment to transparency is evident through initiatives like the impending security audit of their smart contract.</p>
<p>The findings of this audit will soon be public, a move that many projects shy away from.</p>
<p>The founder and project lead, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattw8047814774/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Whiteman</a>, isn’t an unknown entity in the crypto space.</p>

<p>When so many projects hide behind the veil of anonymity, Whiteman’s open profile and the project’s physical address in Amsterdam offer an extra layer of trustworthiness.</p>

<p>Radiologex Technologies Ltd. proudly presents the debut of the R-DEE Protocol<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Network by Radiologex, a bespoke blockchain solution for the global healthcare IT sector.

<h3><b>Purpose-Driven Utility: Elevating Enterprise-Level Blockchain Applications</b></h3>
<p>In tandem with this landmark launch, Radiologex Technologies Ltd. is set to initiate the eagerly anticipated distribution of RDGX tokens. The exclusive Pre-Sale event will present a highly limited offering of just 2.5 million tokens, underscoring the exclusivity and the significant demand forecasted for this consequential digital asset.</p>

A mere 250 Nodes&#8217; worth of RDGX is up for grabs in the pre-sale, prompting interested parties to act promptly.</p>
<p>Node Validators will earn 300 RDGX tokens every 30 days, equating to a significant 3% monthly earning potential and an impressive annual yield of 36%.

<p>The investment arm and incubator of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Binance Labs, has invested in the Memecoin (MEME) token.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-invests-in-meme-the-native-token-of-memeland-from-the-creators-of-9gag-1370020903256087146">According to an announcement on January 4</a>, Binance Labs revealed that it has invested in the naive ecosystem token of Memeland, a project focused on creating and investing in the social economy. However, the size of the investment has yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>Prior to Binance Labs&#8217; investment in MEME, the cryptocurrency was featured as Binance Launchpool&#8217;s 39th project in October 2023. Binance Launchpool is a platform that allows users to stake their Binance Coin (BNB), TUSD, and FDUSD in distinct pools for a 30-day farming adventure, earning MEME tokens as rewards.</p>
<p>On October 28, 2023, Binance officially <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/9gag-meme-memeland-is-memekombat-next.htm">announced</a> this initiative, providing crypto enthusiasts with the opportunity to participate in the Launchpool and earn MEME token rewards. Users could stake their assets in specific pools, and in return, they would receive MEME tokens. A significant pool of 1,380,000,000 MEME tokens, equivalent to 2% of the total token supply, was allocated as rewards for participants in this campaign.</p>
<p>Announced in April 2022, Memeland operates as an independent Web3 venture studio under 9GAG, a well-known meme platform with a monthly audience of 200 million users worldwide. The Memeland team has over fifteen years of experience in creating community-based products and is dedicated to the mission of bringing ownership to communities worldwide.</p>
<p>In addition to NFTs and the MEME token, Memeland offers features such as MEME Farming and plans to introduce upcoming services to enhance user experiences and community involvement. These include unique NFT staking mechanisms, collaborative social networks for community members, and liquid staking of ETH.</p>
<p>The long-term vision is for Memeland to become a fully decentralized, community-driven platform, allowing current NFT holders to participate in governing the Memeland DAO.</p>
<h2><b>Crypto Token MEME Surges 8% After Binance Labs Investment Announcement</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
After Binance Labs&#8217; investment announcement was made, the MEME crypto price shot up by over 8% amid recent declines. However, the gain was short-lived, as the crypto saw a pullback within a few minutes. At press time, the MEME crypto price dropped by 2.67% to $0.02739 on Thursday, January 4, 2023.</p>
<p>Despite the slump, a significant recovery was recorded since the digital asset had earlier witnessed a plunge of over 12% in today&#8217;s trading session. Earlier in the past week, the Memecoin price lost over 5% in value. Furthermore, it plunged by 15% in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>In addition, the crypto&#8217;s market cap dipped by 2.70% to $243.16 million. On the contrary, MEME crypto witnessed a spike in demand. Its 24-hour trade volume skyrocketed by a whopping 352.19% and was recorded to be $268.29 million.</p>
<p>Memeland had previously announced $10 million in commitments for the token sale and is planning airdrops and a firesale for MEME to boost investor interest amidst the coin&#8217;s volatility. The token is predicted to reach $0.1 from a firesale price of $0.001.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.memeland.com/">public details</a>, some upcoming Memeland platforms are travel service <a href="http://holders.com/">Holders.com</a>, video sharing service <a href="http://gmgm.com/">GMGM.com</a>, crypto staking application Stakeland, and Petsland, a pets-focused service.</p>

<p>India&#8217;s digital rupee hit 1 million daily transactions in December, aligning with the Reserve Bank of India&#8217;s targeted goal for daily transactions by the end of 2023, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/indias-digital-currency-transactions-top-1-mlnday-dec-sources-2024-01-04/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p>The central bank digital currency (CBDC), known as the e-rupee, was introduced as a digital alternative to physical cash and was constructed using distributed ledger technology.</p>
<p>The RBI initiated the digital rupee pilot in December 2022. Despite an initial average of only 25,000 transactions per day by the end of October, the use case witnessed significant expansion when linked to the United Payments Interface (UPI), a popular framework facilitating peer-to-peer money transfers via mobile apps.</p>
<h2>Bank Employees Paid in E-Rupee</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As reported earlier, several prominent private and state-run banks, including HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, Canara Bank, and IDFC First Bank, reportedly <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/indian-banks-offer-rewards-to-encourage-digital-rupee-adoption.htm">disbursed employee benefits directly to CBDC wallets,</a> diverging from the traditional salary account method. This strategic move is expected to prompt non-financial firms to follow suit, contributing to further transaction growth.</p>
<p>The user base for the digital rupee has steadily expanded, reaching approximately 4 million users at present, up from 3 million in December, according to a third executive familiar with the pilot.</p>
<p>While sources declined to be identified due to a lack of authorization to speak to the media, it was reported that the RBI is awaiting responses to an email seeking comments on this development.</p>
<h2>Central Banks Across the World Move Forward with CBDC</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Globally, countries such as China, France, and Ghana are in the pilot stages of their <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cbdc/">CBDC projects</a>. Despite efforts, countries like Nigeria have faced limited success in rolling out their digital currencies, even with incentives such as discounts on auto-rickshaw rides.</p>
<p>Indian banks are also actively encouraging e-rupee transactions by offering incentives, following a directive from the RBI to boost transaction volumes. Sharat Chandra, co-founder of the India Blockchain Forum, commended the move, suggesting that compensating employees using CBDC is a positive step, and he recommended exploring other avenues such as toll tax collections to further encourage adoption.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD">XRP price</a> has sunk by 9% in the past 24 hours, falling below the all-important $0.60 support level after a bad day for the cryptocurrency market yesterday.</p>
<p>At $0.576124, the altcoin has lost 10% in a week and 6% in the last 30 days, although it does remain up by 64% in the past year.</p>
<p>And given how much the market has undervalued XRP since Ripple effectively won its case against the SEC last summer, it&#8217;s arguable that the coin has the potential to recover and rally strongly if 2024 brings a bull market.</p>
<h2>XRP Price Prediction as XRP Drops Below $0.60 Support – Time to Buy the Dip?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
XRP&#8217;s chart doesn&#8217;t look particularly great at the moment, with its relative strength index (purple) falling below 40 after several weeks of languishing around the 50 level.</p>
<p>This would indicate that the altcoin has really struggled to gain any kind of concerted momentum in the past couple of months, and that it may even sink even further before returning to growth.</p>
<figure id="attachment_147240" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147240" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-147240" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704366057-xrp-price-chart.png" alt="XRP price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704366057-xrp-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704366057-xrp-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704366057-xrp-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704366057-xrp-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704366057-xrp-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704366057-xrp-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704366057-xrp-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-147240" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Indeed, its 30-day average (yellow) has begun slipping towards its 200-day average (blue), a sign that the coin is losing momentum and that more losses may be forthcoming.</p>
<p>XRP&#8217;s drop below $0.60 is another worry indicator that it could fall further in the near term, with the loss of this support potentially causing more holders to exit their positions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, more positive traders may argue that yesterday&#8217;s dip has made XRP more attractive to newcomers, and that the coin could bounce quickly from its losses.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s currently no real sign of this, yet if the SEC does end up approving several Bitcoin ETFs – as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-surges-to-45000-pending-secs-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">many continue to believe</a> – then the market as a whole will rally strongly, with XRP joining for the ride.</p>
<p>And while XRP has underperformed noticeably in recent weeks, it may be that the market is waiting for the Ripple-SEC to reach its full and final conclusion.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Okay, YES, this does make a full settlement much more likely as the only legal question left is how big a check Ripple writes to the SEC.</p>
<p>There, I said it.  Are you happy now?  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t likely to happen until the summer, when the two parties are likely to arrive at a settlement that will finally draw a line under the long-running legal saga.</p>
<p>And once this happens, Ripple will be in a much better position to grow, with the company potentially able to announce <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-rumors-emerge-of-possible-ripple-ipo-could-xrp-reach-100.htm">its long-awaited IPO</a>.</p>
<p>In such a context, the XRP price will rally considerably, potentially returning to $1, if not higher.</p>
<h2>New Bitcoin Platform Hits $7.2 Million</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For those too impatient to wait for XRP to get its act together, there are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-crypto-buy-now-2024-top-picks-explosive-growth-calsona-6bnie">a wide variety of exciting new tokens in the market</a>, with several presale coins looking like they could rally big upon listing.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">The prime example of this is </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX)</a><span style="font-size: 16px">, an Ethereum-based stake-to-mine platform that has raised in excess of $7.4 million in its token offering.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Given that 2024 is a Bitcoin halving year, interest in mining has understandably increased, and such interest has fed into Bitcoin Minetrix and its sale.</p>
<p>In particular, Bitcoin Minetrix&#8217;s innovative platform lets users mine Bitcoin (BTC) simply by staking its native token, BTCMTX.</p>
<p>Doing this provides users with tokenized mining credits, which they can redeem for Bitcoin hashing power.</p>
<p>By purchasing enough Bitcoin hashing power, users will ultimately receive mined BTC in return for their efforts.</p>
<p>On top of this, staking BTCMXT will earn users a steady passive income, which in combination with mined BTC and any price appreciation could make Bitcoin Minetrix very profitable.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Surpassing $7,200,000 is a stellar way to start 2024.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s to an incredible year ahead!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HappyNewYear?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HappyNewYear</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoMilestone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoMilestone</a> <a href="https://t.co/IGO0Jv70AA">pic.twitter.com/IGO0Jv70AA</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It also helps that Bitcoin Minetrix really simplifies the whole process of Bitcoin mining, with its simple cloud-based mining network easy to use and access.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">Taken together, such features help explain why the platform&#8217;s presale has done so well, with newcomers able to join by visiting </span><a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/bitcoinminetrix/en">the official Bitcoin Minetrix website</a>.</p>
<p>They can buy BTCMTX at a price of $0.0126 per token, although once Bitcoin Minetrix launches and its token lists, this price is likely to rise much higher.</p>

<p>The digital asset market recorded massive highs on several fronts in Q4 2023 as institutional investors tightened their bullish grip on the market in anticipation of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF approval in the United States.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://ccdata.io/reports/digital-asset-management-review-december-2023?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=80901321&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--I7vmQPtCJWL18VLgHDbfVAnCEw_Tgp-kFZH5EPzu44m3DxyOnqYXWbOfs6gMGwXsYN6vD20HJ3os1NOfmzOLVnEPRag&amp;utm_content=80901321&amp;utm_source=hs_email">report released by CCData</a> on the fourth quarter performance of cryptocurrencies shows heightened bullish sentiment sparked by multiple factors leading to positive on-chain metrics.</p>
<p>As more funds entered the markets in December, daily trading volumes rose by 33.9% ending the year on a strong foot. A new 20-month daily trading volume was set at $659.5 million, the largest since January 2022 among cryptocurrency products.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<i>The surge in trading volumes suggests a vigorous trading environment and may indicate an escalating interest in digital asset products.” </i></p></blockquote>
<p>Institutional inflows in crypto funds in 2023 dominated the scene coming back from a horrid 2022 which saw asset prices plunge significantly ushering in the market winter. The rise in asset prints and market conditions saw most platforms record highs not seen in months and bulls continued to point north.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Still, on the institutional front, ProShares BITO recorded a 28% spike in trading volumes to $345.5 million while Grayscale GBTC dominated the narratives, particularly after the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-crypto-asset-management-firm-wins-lawsuit-against-sec.htm">firm’s court victory</a> over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on its spot BTC ETF application posted a 67% increase to $197.8 million.</p>
<p><i>“Purpose Invest BTCC experienced modest growth, with volumes nudging up by 1.6% to $10.3 million. ProShares BITI, conversely, had a robust increase of nearly 49.8%, translating to approximately $33.8 million in average daily volume. Grayscale GDLC&#8217;s volume more than doubled, soaring by 64% to nearly $3 million,”</i> the report added.</p>
<h2>Crypto Assets Under Management Soars</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
AUM growth in the past 12 months was also characterized by strong favorite market conditions particularly increased transactional volumes and the spot ETF anticipation.</p>
<p>While the SEC is yet to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-amends-bitcoin-etf-application-excludes-authorized-participant-details.htm">approve a spot BTC ETF</a> citing market manipulation concerns, new developments heightened the belief that an approval is imminent.</p>
<p>As a result, wealth managers recorded a significant spike in AUM across virtual asset products as Bitcoin and altcoins saw massive inflows. According to the report, AUM grew by 14% in December to $49.6 billion, a figure that has yet to be tapped since March 2022.</p>
<p>A 152% increase was posted throughout the year with Bitcoin products accounting for over $35 billion.

<p>Blockchain analysts from <strong>Match Systems</strong> have found that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/orbit-chain-hacker-swaps-stolen-usdt-for-eth-rakes-in-1-45-million-profits.htm"><strong>Orbit Chain</strong></a> hackers used the same tactics as those in several other high-profile attacks &#8211; suggesting that a cybercrime organization, possibly the infamous <strong>Lazarus Group</strong>, stands behind these hacks.</p>
<p>This criminal group seems to have been busy last year. Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/orbit-hacker-may-have-also-performed-coinspaid-coinex-hacks-onchain-experts">cited</a> a January 3, 2024, report by Match Systems, naming <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/north-koreas-lazarus-group-suspected-37-million-hack-coinspaid.htm"><strong>Coinspaid</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinex-crypto-exchange-hit-by-28-million-exploit-four-hot-wallets-drained.htm"><strong>Coinex</strong></a>, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/atomic-wallet-hackers-hide-35-million-stolen-crypto-funds-using-thorchain-heres-what-you-need-know.htm"><strong>Atomic Wallet</strong></a> among the group&#8217;s victims.</p>
<p>Per the report,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[The analysis] gives reason to believe that the same criminal group may be involved in the hacking of the Orbit bridge, which in 2023 had previously committed several large hacks of the cryptocurrency services Atomic wallet, CoinsPaid, CoinEx, etc., using tools and patterns of the well-known Lazarus group.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As the new year approached, hackers <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/orbit-suspends-cross-chain-bridge-contract-after-82m-exploit.htm">exploited</a> <strong>Orbit Bridge</strong>, the cross-chain bridging service of a South Korean-based multi-asset Orbit Chain, making off with $82 million.</p>

<h2>Common Threads</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The analysts found that the hackers used <strong>Tornado Cash</strong>. They had gas funds from other accounts that <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5e35f4b1886d62543cc027b5c0ef54aac3901a25c37d8ea6b1ab8861c9bd09dd">withdrew them</a> from the popular crypto mixer.</p>
<p>A mixer does &#8216;mixes&#8217; different funds in order to obscure the trail leading back to the original sources. Therefore, hackers use it to mix their identifiable funds with others&#8217; funds.</p>
<p>That said, Match System reportedly &#8216;de-mixed&#8217; the funds using specialized software. It analyzed the &#8220;characteristics and patterns before and after the Tornado.cash mixer, considering transaction volumes and dates/times, as well as other specialized methods.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the team discovered was a group of addresses. One of them used the <strong>SWFT</strong> protocol to transfer funds to other addresses. The protocol was also used in the <strong>DFX Finance</strong>, <strong>Deribit</strong>, and <strong>AscendEX</strong> attacks.</p>
<p>Following the Oribit attack, a portion of the funds sent through SWFT traveled through a number of chains, gathering in a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cybersecurity-firm-dwallet-labs-discovers-fixes-500-million-vulnerability-tron-network.htm"><strong>Tron</strong></a> wallet. It was then transferred to an exchange and cashed out.</p>
<p>Another common factor, the analysts argue, is that the attackers used <strong>Avalanche Bridge</strong> and <strong>Sinbad</strong> in the Orbit attack and several earlier attacks.</p>
<p>Per the team,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[These are] tools and patterns of the well-known Lazarus group.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2>Lazarus was Responsible for a Fifth of Total Losses in 2023</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The North Korea-affiliated hacker group <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/report-lazarus-group-deploys-new-kandykorn-malware-in-crypto-exchange-attack.htm">Lazarus</a> was responsible for $308.6 million stolen in 2023, the major bug bounty and security services platform <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/immunefis-november-crypto-losses-show-343m-lost-to-frauds-and-hacks-cefi-platforms-account-for-53-losses.htm"><strong>Immunefi</strong></a> found. This is a whopping 17% of the total year losses.</p>
<p>The group was allegedly behind the high-profile attacks on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/atomic-wallet-announces-bug-bounty-program-1-million-up-for-grabs.htm"><strong>Atomic Wallet</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/elliptic-blockchain-surveillance-firm-north-korean-lazarus-group-theft-spree-reaches-240-million-104-days.htm"><strong>CoinEx</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/data-shows-north-korean-lazarus-group-accumulated-bitcoin-valued-over-40m.htm"><strong>Alphapo</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fbi-identifies-north-korean-lazarus-group-as-culprit-behind-41-million-stake-casino-hack.htm"><strong>Stake</strong></a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/north-koreas-lazarus-group-suspected-37-million-hack-coinspaid.htm"><strong>CoinsPaid</strong></a>, and the massive <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/north-koreas-lazarus-group-behind-axie-infinitys-ronin-hack-say-us-treasury-fbi.htm"><strong>Ronin Network</strong></a> attack, resulting in a $625 million loss.</p>

<p>The Immunefi team recently <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/EhGU8jztu6R938dcMfI9Q/b8e6bf8f6bdba576e547875abd916414/Immunefi_Lazarus_Group_Report.pdf">published</a> a report focusing specifically on the Lazarus Group. It found that, between 2021 and 2023, the group stole $1,903,600,000 across the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>In December, Immunefi CEO Mitchell Amador commented that,</p>
<blockquote><p>“As we approach 2024, their escalating sophistication is concerning.

<h2>Rodarmor Defends Bitcoin Ordinals Against Censorship Calls</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://rodarmor.com/blog/inscriptions-a-guide-for-the-ideological-maxi/">Rodarmor argued that attempts to censor <strong>Bitcoin ordinals</strong> could open the door to broader censorship efforts</a>, contending nothing can feasibly stop people from leveraging Bitcoin&#8217;s transparency.</p>
<p>He believes maximalists uncomfortably reject reality when attacking functionality beyond payments, he wrote.</p>
<p>Rodarmor contends the reality is that nothing can feasibly stop people from leveraging the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">blockchain&#8217;s transparency</a> for purposes maximalists deem frivolous or illegitimate, like inscribing arbitrary images and messages.</p>
<p>According to the post, he believes the maximalist desire to restrict Bitcoin&#8217;s use stems from an &#8220;uncomfortable contact with a reality&#8221; that fails to match their ideological vision. This causes them to reactively attack anything that expands functionality beyond payments.</p>
<p>While indifferent about defending inscriptions themselves, Rodarmor categorically rejects technocratic tinkering to block any valid transactions, no matter how objectionable. For him, maintaining <strong>&#8220;uncensorable&#8221;</strong> as a <strong>core attribute</strong> of <strong>Bitcoin</strong> overrides other considerations.</p>
<h2><strong>Embracing Bitcoin Ordinals&#8217; Market Potential</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Instead, Rodarmor proposes allowing <strong>free market dynamics</strong> to naturally determine the value of inscriptions and other applications competing for limited block space.</p>
<p>He claims the inevitable solution is <strong>high on-chain fees</strong> pricing out lower-value uses like trivial media.&#8221;Bitcoin&#8217;s destiny is high fees. Embrace it,&#8221; Rodarmor wrote.</p>
<p>He advised maximalists to &#8220;stop being losers&#8221; by redirecting efforts toward expanding <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s reach</strong> and <strong>real-world usage</strong> rather than hampering new functionalities.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Rodarmor believes the path to cryptocurrency&#8217;s mass acceptance requires embracing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/decoding-web3-blockchain-laboratories-set-to-revolutionize-esg-markets-with-innovative-solutions.htm">outside-the-box enhancements on top of Bitcoin</a> and letting its full, dynamic potential unfold. Restricting possibilities risks turning an open platform into a <strong>narrow orthodoxy</strong>.</p>
<p>At its core, Rodarmor makes a compelling case for letting the free market run its course. If Bitcoin is to fulfill its destiny as an open, decentralized ledger, the community must resist the urge to over-engineer every perceived problem.</p>
<p>With a spirit of openness and a balance of pragmatism, Bitcoin can move beyond a radical idea into a global force for <strong>economic freedom</strong>.</p>

<p>South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Korea has <a href="https://www.hb.co.kr/ko-kr/">announced the shut down</a> of its services with effect from January 29, 2024. The decision comes in response to what the company described as a challenging &#8220;business environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Established in 2017, Huobi Korea had severed ties with HTX (formerly Huobi Global) in January 2023. The closure announcement follows similar decisions by other smaller South Korean exchanges, including Cashierest and Coinbit, in November, along with the suspension of trading services by CoreDAX, which reportedly faced financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Huobi Korea assured its users that they would be able to withdraw their funds even after the shutdown, emphasizing a commitment to ensuring a smooth transition for its customer base.</p>
<h2>Handful of Exchanges Dominate Korean Market</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The company&#8217;s decision aligns with a trend observed in the South Korean cryptocurrency market, with the top five exchanges—Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax—<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-crypto-exchanges-scrap-for-survival-as-upbit-dominance-wanes.htm">dominating 99.6% of the total crypto trade volume</a> as of June 30, 2023, according to the Financial Services Commission (FSC).</p>
<p>South Korea&#8217;s stringent regulatory environment for cryptocurrency exchanges, introduced through a 2021 amendment to the financial reporting law, requires these platforms to maintain a partnership agreement with a local bank to offer fiat-to-crypto services. The aim is to mitigate risks associated with money laundering and price manipulation. However, Huobi Korea, along with 20 other exchanges, failed to secure such partnerships, limiting them to crypto-to-crypto trading.</p>
<h2>New Crypto Rules to Come into Effect This Year</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD">Solana price</a> has dropped by 9% in the past 24 hours, sinking down to $98.69 after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/over-460-million-longs-liquidated-in-past-hour-as-bitcoin-drops-8-on-spot-etf-delay-rumors.htm">fears over another Bitcoin ETF delay</a> pulled the wider market down yesterday.</p>
<p>Even with the sharp pullback, SOL remains up by 14% in a fortnight and by 64% in the last 30 days, with the altcoin also sitting on an impressive 611% increase in the past year.</p>
<p>And now that it seems as though things have stabilized, SOL may begin regaining its former momentum yet again, with the coin already up by 5% from its 24-hour low.</p>
<h2>Solana Price Prediction as SOL Falls 9% Overnight – Are Investors Regaining Confidence?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SOL&#8217;s chart leaves space for further falls before the coin corrects itself more decisively, given that its indicators had been in overbought positions for several weeks prior to yesterday&#8217;s tumble.</p>
<p>For instance, its RSI (purple) remains below 60 after peaking at around 85 on Christmas Day, with the indicator showing little sign of a clear improvement at the moment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_147219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147219" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-147219" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704362732-solana-price-chart.png" alt="Solana price chart." width="2560" height="1328" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704362732-solana-price-chart.png 2560w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704362732-solana-price-chart-300x156.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704362732-solana-price-chart-1024x531.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704362732-solana-price-chart-768x398.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704362732-solana-price-chart-1536x797.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704362732-solana-price-chart-2048x1062.png 2048w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704362732-solana-price-chart-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-147219" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, SOL&#8217;s 30-day average (yellow) has remained substantially above its 200-day (blue) for a couple of months now, implying that a correction downwards is in order.</p>
<p>This could mean that yesterday&#8217;s pain will reoccur, and that the Solana price may wobble some more in the near term.</p>
<p>Having said that, the coin&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume remains high at around $5 billion, which is still well above the levels it witnessed even a month ago (between $2 billion and $3 billion).</p>
<p>Plus, its support level (green) has resisted significant falls in the past few weeks, so even if SOL drops in the short-term, it probably isn&#8217;t going to drop too far.</p>
<p>Its medium- and long-term prospects also look good, with the possibility of Bitcoin ETF approvals likely to send SOL flying even further, along with the market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It took over ten years, but we’re finally on the verge of having spot bitcoin ETFs approved in the USA.</p>
<p>(Yes, we are.)</p>
<p>Many deserve credit for this milestone, but chiefly <a href="https://twitter.com/Grayscale?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Grayscale</a> and its lawyers, who had the guts to fight this out in court and won.</p>
<p>Let’s fight more in 2024.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Not only that, but Solana itself will have plenty of reasons to appreciate in value, with <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana">its blockchain witnessing its total value locked in steadily rise</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, it has gained by about 555% since the beginning of 2023, with Solana now the fourth-biggest layer-one network by TVL.</p>
<p>Thanks to such fundamentals, which includes <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-nfts-eclipse-ethereum-in-trading-volume-amid-surge.htm">the growth of NFT usage on Solana</a>, the Solana price is likely to continue rising well into 2024.</p>
<p>Assuming a fully fledged bull market, it could reach $200 by the summer.</p>
<h2>New Meme Tokens for New Market-Beating Rallies</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Because BONK could be potentially in the middle of a longer term decline, many traders may prefer to consider newer meme tokens, especially those which are still looking forward to their initial growth spurts.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">A very good example of such a coin is <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat (MK)</a>, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised more than $3.7 million in its increasingly popular presale.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<figure class="media"></figure>
<p>What sets Meme Kombat apart from most other meme tokens is that it offers some real utility, with its platform enabling users to bet on AI-generated meme battles.</p>
<p>Such battles have randomized outcomes, with results processed on-chain, ensuring 100% transparency and fairness.</p>
<p>In addition, Meme Kombat will visualize the battles in real-time for users to watch, providing an entertaining backdrop for their bets.</p>
<p>They can bet against each other or against the platform itself, with Meme Kombat paying out winnings in the form of MK tokens.</p>
<p>It gets better, because MK holders can also stake the token for a passive income, with the coin having a max supply of 120 million.</p>
<p>The sale is aiming to raise $5 million, with investors able to join by visiting the<span style="font-size: medium"> <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/memekombat">Meme Kombat official website</a>.</p>

<p>2023 saw a 51% decline in the digital assets lost to hacks, scams and exploits than that of 2022. However, a staggering $1.84 billion in cryptocurrencies were lost across 751 security breaches in 2023, blockchain security firm CertiK reveals.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/1f5aebc9-648a-451c-abd9-d3b471840d4d">2023 “Hack3d” report</a> published Wednesday, highlighted major exploits and incidents that led to this ten-digit number. Per the data, 2023 losses were down 51% from 2022’s total of $3.7 billion.</p>
<p>“Although $1.8 billion is a significant decline from 2022, it’s still too much,” CertiK analysts noted.</p>
<figure id="attachment_147224" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147224" style="width: 868px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-147224" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704363223-defillama.png" alt="" width="868" height="395" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704363223-defillama.png 868w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704363223-defillama-300x137.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704363223-defillama-768x349.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1704363223-defillama-150x68.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-147224" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DefiLlama</figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, data revealed that the Q3 of 2023 saw the most losses at $686,558,472 from 183 hacks and scams. “November was the most costly month of the year,” it added.</p>
<h1>Private Key Compromised</h1>
<p>The study attributed the cause of several digital asset breaches to private key compromises.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Six of the ten most costly security incidents over the course of 2023 were due to private key compromises.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Private key compromises were the costliest attack vectors with $880,892,924 worth of crypto assets lost in just 47 incidents. The figures represent nearly half of all financial losses, though these compromises represented just 6.3% of all security breaches this year.</p>
<p>CertiK suggested some of the private key management best practices to avoid future breaches. These include multi-signature wallets, hardware wallets, access control policies, encrypted storage and regular monitoring of the use of private keys.</p>
<h1>CertiK Report Highlights Emerging Trend of Bug Bounty</h1>
<p>The report highlighted the emerging trend of “retroactive bug bounties” in 2023, with $219 million returned across 36 events. This represents 12% of the $1.84 billion lost in total, it added.</p>
<p>Several protocols have successfully negotiated “grey hat” bounties, leading to hackers returning significant portions of stolen funds. For instance, Euler Finance fell victim to a flash loan attack in March, resulting in over $197 million in losses.</p>
<p>The DeFi protocol later offered a $1 million bounty for information leading to the arrest of the attackers and demanded the return of the stolen funds.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Euler exploiter returned a total of 84,951 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">Ether</a>, worth approximately $147.8 million, and $29.9 million in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dai/">DAI stablecoin</a>.</p>
<p>Ronghui Gu, co-founder of CertiK, sees a positive growth in blockchain security in 2024. “The growth of bug bounty platforms and other proactive security measures is a good sign,” Gu said. “Hopefully, we will see a continued decline in losses throughout 2024.”</p>
<p>CertiK analysts further predicted that the crypto bull market will put the industry’s security to the test. “Looking ahead, the real test of DeFi’s improved security protocols awaits in the resurgence of a bull market,” the report added.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The expectation isn&#8217;t to eliminate losses entirely — an unrealistic goal in an industry that prides itself on cutting-edge innovation — but to continue reducing the correlation between total value locked (TVL) and losses to hacks and scams.”</p></blockquote>

The $RETIK token has an impressive total supply of 1 billion and is currently available at a presale price of $0.06 per unit. Notably, the presale has garnered significant interest, with almost 95 million tokens already acquired by eager early adopters.

Upon the end of this phase, it will be further increased to $0.07 in the subsequent phase.
