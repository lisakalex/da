<p><b>Blockchain technology</b> is witnessing a major shiftâone that promises to reshape how we think about and interact with <b>digital ledgers</b>. We&#8217;re talking about the emergence of parallelized <b>Ethereum Virtual Machines</b> (EVMs), a development that may redefine transaction processing in blockchain networks.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs offer an alternative to how blockchain networks currently manage and process transactions. By reducing congestion, especially during periods of high demand, <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fanl/papers/parallel-icse22.pdf">parallel execution</a> offers a more streamlined and efficient experience for users.</p>
<h2>Understanding Parallelized EVMs and Their Impact on Blockchain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Historically, the execution of operations in blockchain networks has followed a <b>sequential pattern</b>. Each transaction within a block is processed one after the other, demanding comprehensive validation from the network. While this method has underpinned the robust and secure nature of blockchain technology, it has not been without its drawbacks.</p>
<p><iframe title="What Is The EVM In 2 Minutes (Ethereum Virtual Machine)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTlT3I-Iy5o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4274&amp;context=thesesdissertations">Sequential processing</a> is both energy-intensive and places a high workload on network validators. The result has often been <b>high transaction costs</b> and a <b>less efficient user experience</b>âissues that have frequently been cited as barriers to wider <b>blockchain adoption</b>.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs transform the consensus process by enabling multiple operations to be executed simultaneously. The parallel execution capability greatly increases the <b>network&#8217;s throughput</b>, enhancing the overall performance and <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/89f5c7cd-c139-486c-8f35-00f15d7b21fe/content">scalability of the blockchain</a>.</p>
<p>With Parallelized EVMs, blockchain networks can handle more transactions in a shorter period, effectively addressing <b>congestion issues</b> and <b>slow processing times</b> that have often plagued traditional blockchain systems.</p>
<p>The impact extends to various aspects of blockchain technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>It offers a more <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6287639/10005208/10102454.pdf">energy-efficient approach</a> to transaction processing. By reducing the workload on validators and the network at large, parallelized EVMs contribute to a more <b>sustainable blockchain</b> ecosystem.</li>
<li>The enhanced scalability and increased throughput directly translate to reduced transaction fees. Users benefit from a more <b>cost-effective</b> experience, making blockchain platforms more accessible and appealing to a broader audience.</li>
<li>The ability to process multiple transactions concurrently rather than sequentially means <b>decentralized applications</b> (dApps) can operate more seamlessly, even during periods of high network demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>This technological advancement not only improves the user experience but also opens new possibilities for complex and high-volume applications on the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Parallelized EVMs in Ethereum and Beyond</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The benefits of parallelized EVMs are not confined to Ethereum alone. They are also being integrated into other blockchain platforms, such as Solana, which is known for its <a href="https://solana.com/news/case-study-pyth">high throughput and low latency</a>.</p>
<p>By adopting a parallelized EVM on a platform like Solana, the potential for scalability and performance is magnified. This integration allows for a seamless execution of transactions across multiple nodes concurrently, greatly enhancing the network&#8217;s capacity to handle large volumes of transactions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">CT saying parallelized chains are the future</p>
<p>Parallelized chains are the *present*. </p>
<p>Chains like <a href="https://twitter.com/solana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@solana</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Aptos_Network?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Aptos_Network</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SeiNetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SeiNetwork</a> (and <a href="https://twitter.com/monad_xyz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@monad_xyz</a> is coming)  </p>

<p>Go try one. Compare the speed. Compare the fees to these</p>
<p>Just try. <a href="https://t.co/31SCcpN7KD">pic.twitter.com/31SCcpN7KD</a></p>
<p>&mdash; GJ Flannery (@GJFlannery19) <a href="https://twitter.com/GJFlannery19/status/1736955357014946282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This advancement is particularly crucial for a wide range of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-build-decentralized-application-dapp.htm">decentralized applications</a>. Whether it&#8217;s in the DeFi, gaming, decentralized autonomous organizations, or <strong>decentralized exchanges</strong>, the adoption of parallelized EVMs will ensure that these applications can operate efficiently without overwhelming the network.</p>
<p>This is a critical factor in ensuring the long-term viability and success of dApps, as it addresses <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/24941/blockchain-and-the-scalability-challenge-solving-the-blockchain-trilemma">one of the biggest challenges they face</a>: scalability.</p>
<h3>The Developer&#8217;s Role in Maximizing Benefits</h3>
<p>The successful implementation and optimization of parallelized EVMs are heavily reliant on the foresight and skill of developers. To fully harness the <a href="https://suipiens.com/blog/understanding-parallel-execution-in-blockchain/">capabilities of parallelized technology</a> in blockchain, developers must integrate considerations for parallel processing from the inception of their projects.</p>
<p>This is particularly crucial when designing <strong>smart contracts</strong> and data structures, as these elements play a key role in determining whether transactions can be executed in parallel.</p>
<p>In the context of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a>, the design must accommodate parallel execution to ensure different transactions can operate independently without interference. For example, if a smart contract utilizes the same data structure for various transactions, it restricts the possibility of <strong>parallel processing</strong>. Developers must carefully structure their contracts and associated data to avoid such limitations.</p>
<p>The requirement for thoughtful design extends to <strong>data structures</strong> as well. Effective use of parallelized EVMs necessitates data structures that support <strong>independent transactions</strong>. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of transaction processing but also ensures that the full potential of parallelized technology is leveraged.</p>
<p>The role of developers, therefore, is not just about coding but also about <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37902833/">architectural planning</a> and strategic thinking. By designing with parallel processing in mind, developers can create dApps that are not only novel but also capable of operating at an unprecedented scale and efficiency.</p>
<p>This proactive approach is essential in unlocking the power of parallelized EVMs, making blockchain technology more <strong>adaptable, efficient, and scalable</strong>.</p>
<h2>Comparing Parallelized EVMs with DAG</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As a scalable blockchain technology, parallelized EVMs represent a major advancement. It&#8217;s instructive to compare them with other scalable technologies, however, such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34460402/">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</a>, to appreciate their unique contributions and potential in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>DAG presents an alternative approach to achieving scalability. Unlike traditional blockchains that chain blocks in a linear sequence, DAG structures allow <a href="https://hedera.com/learning/distributed-ledger-technologies/directed-acyclic-graph">transactions to be linked in a graph format</a>, where multiple transactions can be added concurrently.</p>
<figure id="attachment_145839" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145839" style="width: 1227px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-145839 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt.png" alt="Directed Acyclic Graph vs Blockchain" width="1227" height="323" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt.png 1227w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-300x79.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-1024x270.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-768x202.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-150x39.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1227px) 100vw, 1227px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-145839" class="wp-caption-text">Image by <a href="https://www.cbcamerica.org/blockchain-insights/dag-the-dlt-directed-acyclic-graph-for-enterprise-blockchain">Central Blockchain Council</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This structure substantially reduces the time needed for transaction confirmation and increases the network&#8217;s ability to handle <strong>high transaction volumes</strong>. DAG technology is known for its low transaction fees and high scalability, making it an attractive choice for applications requiring fast and efficient transaction processing.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs offer distinct advantages over DAG, however, particularly in the context of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/top-5-ethereum-dapp-games-1979.htm">Ethereum-based applications</a>. While DAG excels in transaction speed and scalability, it does not inherently support smart contracts and decentralized applications in the same way Ethereum does.</p>
<p>They retain the robust smart contract capabilities of Ethereum while enhancing scalability and efficiency through parallel processing. This makes them particularly suitable for complex decentralized applications that require both smart contract functionality and high transaction throughput.</p>
<p>Additionally, parallelized EVMs maintain compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem, which is a critical consideration for developers and users already entrenched in Ethereum-based applications. This compatibility ensures a smoother transition and integration for existing dApps, which is a challenge in DAG-based systems that often require major modifications to existing applications.</p>
<h2>Spotlight on Projects Developing Parallelized EVMs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The evolution of parallelized EVMs is not occurring in isolation. Several projects are leading the charge of this technological shift, each contributing unique insights and advancements to the blockchain world. Three such projectsâSEI, Neon EVM, and Monadâare working to integrate the technology into their platforms, setting new benchmarks in blockchain scalability and efficiency.</p>

<h3>Monad: The Future of Ethereum-Compatible Blockchains</h3>
<p><a href="https://monad.xyz/">Monad</a> represents the next step in <strong>Ethereum-compatible Layer 1</strong> blockchains. Currently in development, with a <strong>testnet launch</strong> anticipated in Q1 2024, Monad seeks to balance decentralization with scalability, targeting a throughput of 10,000 transactions per second.</p>
<p>Its compatibility with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/federico-kunze-kullmer-evmos-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-on-cosmos-437.htm">Ethereum&#8217;s Virtual Machine</a> means that developers familiar with Ethereum can easily transition to Monad. The platform&#8217;s design incorporates various optimizations, such as MonadBFT and <a href="https://docs.monad.xyz/technical-discussion/consensus/deferred-execution">Deferred Execution</a>, to boost performance.</p>
<p>Additionally, Monad&#8217;s architecture will support asynchronous, parallel execution of EVM transactions, enhancing its processing capabilities and positioning it as a potential game-changer in the blockchain space.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>A New Chapter in Blockchain Technology</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The advent of parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) marks a key moment in the evolution of blockchain technology. This leap forward is not just a technical upgrade; it signifies a major shift in how blockchain networks can operate, enhancing scalability, reducing fees, and improving overall performance.</p>
<p>The transition from sequential to parallel processing in EVMs addresses critical challenges that have long been barriers to broader blockchain adoption.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs bring about a transformative change for both developers and users. For developers, the shift necessitates a strategic approach to smart contract and data structure design, emphasizing the importance of architectural planning in maximizing the benefits of parallel processing. For users, this technological advancement translates to faster, more efficient transactions and an enhanced overall experience.</p>
<p>Projects like SEI, Neon EVM, and Monad are leading this technology, each contributing uniquely to the development of parallelized EVMs.</p>
<p>From decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming applications and beyond, the ability to process transactions concurrently rather than sequentially means these applications can operate more smoothly and at a scale previously unattainable.</p>

<p>Ethereum co-founder <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-proposes-enshrined-zk-evm-for-enhanced-ethereum-main-chain-efficiency.htm">Vitalik Buterin</a> has proposed three alternative methods aimed at simplifying the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/donald-trump-sells-2-4-million-ethereum-arkham-intelligence.htm">Ethereum</a> blockchain&#8217;s proof of stake design.</p>
<p>This initiative, according to Buterinâs latest <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/sticking-to-8192-signatures-per-slot-post-ssf-how-and-why/17989">blog post</a>, is intended to address a potential systemic complexity within Ethereum&#8217;s consensus mechanism. The proposals center on reducing the number of signatures required per slot in the blockchain.</p>
<p>According to Buterin, Ethereum is currently supporting 895,000 validator objects for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/iosco-publishes-policy-recommendations-for-decentralized-finance-defi.htm">decentralization</a>, processing about 28,000 signatures in a single day and 1,790,000 post-SSF. His detailed idea intended to reduce the load to 8,192 signatures per slot post-SSF.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Proof of Stake Simplification Proposal</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Buterin&#8217;s first proposal, the shift towards decentralized staking pools, aims to simplify the proof of stake process by reducing the number of individual validators. This approach requires increasing the minimum ether required for staking, thereby compelling smaller validators to form pools.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.<a href="https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g">https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g</a></p>
<p>&mdash; vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1740066206185611594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;We could raise the min deposit size to 4,096 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-sec-delays-hashdex-and-grayscale-ethereum-based-etfs-whats-going-on.htm">ETH</a> and make a total cap of 4,096 validators,&#8221; said Buterin.</p>
<p>The second proposal introduces a dual-layer of stakers to ensure network security and efficiency. Buterin explained this as creating &#8220;a &#8216;heavy&#8217; layer with a 4,096 ETH requirement that participates in finalization, and a &#8216;light&#8217; layer with no minimum.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buterin&#8217;s third proposal, involving a rotating set of validators, is designed to distribute the validation process more evenly across the network. He suggests, &#8220;For each slot, we choose 4,096 currently active validators, and we carefully adjust that set during each slot in such a way that we still have safety.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8220;Why Not Just Do Committees&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Vitalik Buterin highlighted the limitations of the committee-based security model used by other blockchains. This model, which selects a group of validators randomly for each slot, lacks accountability in case of a 51% attack. In such an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/thunder-terminal-claims-security-after-192000-exploit-hacker-demands-ransom-in-dispute.htm">attack</a>, the economic cost to the perpetrators is minimal since most validators involved in the attack remain unseen, not being chosen for the committee.</p>
<p>Contrastingly, Ethereumâs current system imposes severe penalties for similar attacks, slashing a large fraction of the attacking validators&#8217; deposits. While Ethereum&#8217;s high penalty approach is effective, it might be excessively punitive. So a balanced solution that still maintains a high total amount of slashable Ethereum but makes some concessions on validator accountability would be the answer.</p>

<p>Arkham Intelligence <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-president-donald-trumps-crypto-wallet-being-monitored-by-arkham-intelligence-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">tracked and identified</a> the <a href="https://twitter.com/arkhamintel/status/1691875444809781337?s=46&amp;t=RmJrzTiRa1U2w7w0BraS4g">wallet</a> in August and claimed that it was owned by the former U.S. President.

<h2>Trump and Biden Criticized for Not Understanding Crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Initially <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/donald-trump-99-nfts-sbf-arrest-crypto-week-in-review.htm">released</a> in December 2022, Trumpâs trading cards marked his involvement in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. In the meantime, Trump and President Joe Biden were <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/democratic-presidential-candidate-dean-phillips-says-biden-and-trump-dont-understand-crypto.htm">criticized</a> for not understanding crypto by Representative Dean Phillips.</p>
<p>During the Crypto Presidential Forum, Democratic nominee Phillips acknowledged his own gaps in knowledge about financial technology and digital assets, but pointed out the scarcity of expertise in Congress regarding these topics, specifically targeting Trump and Biden.</p>
<p>âThe two leading candidates right now, on both the left and the right, for the U.S. presidency are absolutely not in positions to understand it, prepare us for it, anticipate it, and lead us into the next century,â said Phillips. âJoe Biden and Donald Trump, at their age and stage of life, are simply not the right people to lead us forward.â</p>
<h2>The &#8220;MugShot&#8221; Edition Trading Cards</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Earlier this month, Trump introduced his latest <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trump-released-latest-mugshot-nfts-commemorating-his-previous-arrest.htm">âMugShotâ edition</a> NFT collection, referring to his previous arrest. Buyers who purchase 47 or more of these $99 priced digital trading cards will be granted a dinner with Trump and a piece of the suit he wore during his arrest.</p>

The report further noted that phishing schemes generated $66.15 million during the same time period. According to findings from Beosin, the Ethereum blockchain underwent the most losses and incidents overall.</p>

<h2><b>Updated framework for reviewing smart contract code</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chaals Nevile, technical program director at the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) â an organization that aims to drive the use of enterprise ethereum as an open standard â told Cryptonews that there are known problems within Ethereum that are impacting the ecosystemâs security. âThe most obvious problem is that the Solidity compiler â which outputs byte code and other artifacts needed for deployment of smart contracts â has bugs. As the compiler evolves, old bugs are fixed, but new ones are also created,â said Nevile.</p>
<p>In order to address this and other challenges, the EEA established the â<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-advances-with-standards-for-smart-contract-security-audits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EthTrust Security Levels Working Group in November 2020</a>.â In August 2022, the group released the publication of the âEthTrust Security Levels Specification v1.â This specification has since served as a framework for developers, organizations and customers leveraging and reviewing smart contract code written in Solidity, Ethereumâs main programming language.</p>
<p>Yet as the Ethereum network continues to advance, Nevile pointed out that the EthTrust Security Levels Specification required updates to reflect ongoing and new security developments. âFor instance, the v1 specification covers bugs up to about the year 2022, yet new bugs were discovered after we released v1,â he said.</p>
<p>This in mind, Nevile shared that today the EEA announced the release of<a href="http://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Version 2.0 of its EthTrust Security Levels Specification</a>. Neville noted that the EthTrust Security Levels Specification v2 addresses issues such as newly discovered bugs in the <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solidity-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solidity compiler</a>, treatment of rounding errors, more vigorous treatment of read-only reentrancy attacks and more.</p>
<p>Updates are critical, as the Ethereum ecosystem has fallen victim to security exploits in the past due to these specific issues. For instance, Michael Lewellen, head of solutions architecture at OpenZeppelin â a security firm building an open-source framework to secure smart contracts â told Cryptonews that â<a href="https://neptunemutual.com/blog/the-story-behind-the-dao-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The DAO</a>â hack occurred due to reentrancy. âThe DAO Hack was the original big hack on Ethereum that happened in 2016 and got everyone thinking more about security. This was a classic case of reentrancy,â Lewellen said. The DAO hack resulted in a loss of $3.64 million in ETH.</p>
<p>Nevile explained that <a href="https://medium.com/@zokyo.io/read-only-reentrancy-attacks-understanding-the-threat-to-your-smart-contracts-99444c0a7334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reentrancy</a> occurs when a developer starts a smart contract and then requests for the program to do something different while it is in the middle of running code. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>âEssentially this means that a program is halfway through running code, but then something else is asked of it. As a result, the two requests could get mixed up. A program hacker can then use this mix up as an opportunity to steal people&#8217;s money or change the prompt of things.â</p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Will an industry standard be widely adopted?Â </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Aware of the severity behind such incidents, Lewellen pointed out that OpenZeppelin leverages the EthTrust Security Levels v1 framework to prevent such security vulnerabilities from occurring. âWe use this framework as a pre-audit assessment for many of our clients. This allows clients to know that we are checking for certain instances during the audit process.â</p>
<p>This industry standard seems to be helpful, as an anonymous OpenZeppelin client revealed to Cryptonews that EthTrust is what the company had been lacking in the past. The source said:</p>
<blockquote><p>âWe failed our previous security audit because we didn&#8217;t have clear guidance on what security requirements we were missing. We feel much more confident going into our next audit after reviewing the EthTrust requirements and implementing them in our codebase.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet Nevile commented that while feedback for the EthTrust standard v1 has been positive, it remains challenging getting developers and organizations to know that such an open standard exists. He also noted that the framework is best suited for newer Ethereum projects. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>âProjects like Uniswap, Aave and others may look at these specifications and find them to be useful, but for the most part it&#8217;s common knowledge for them. Projects that are just now being developed and going to production on Ethereum will likely find these specifications to be valuable.â</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the question remains whether or not such an industry standard will help prevent security exploits on Ethereum moving forward. John Wingate, founder and chief executive officer of BankSocial â a financial services company that leverages blockchain technology â told Cryptonews that the changing nature of industry standards is problematic. âStandards are always changing; languages are always depreciating methods, variables, data types, and object types,â he said.</p>
<p>This concern in mind, Nevile shared that version 3 of the EthTrust specification is already in the works. âWe are roughly 16 months between publications. I think that 12 to 18 months is a frequent enough revision to ensure that we donât fall out of date.â</p>
<p>Although this may be, Wingate believes that repeatable, automated testing is the only way to make sure decentralized applications are adhering to best practices that may prevent security exploits. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>âThis means being able to set your platform up to have regular, automated, code testing. When the source code, or compiler is known to have a bug, the automation tool can be updated and then everyone gets the benefit of scanning for the exploits.â</p></blockquote>

<p>Taipei Blockchain Week kicked off this week with around 2,000 people from the crypto community gathering on Thursday to hear industry players discuss blockchain trends ranging from Llayer 1&#8217;s role in Web3&#8217;s in 2024 to the future of decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-news/">DeFi</a>).</p>
<p>The event opened with a keynote speech from the Mayor of Taipei, Chiang Wan-an who welcomed innovation to the city. High-profile guest speakers included Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, and Binanceâs new CEO Richard Teng who spoke about the importance of regulation in the crypto space.</p>
<p>From a live stream Teng, a former Abu Dhabi regulator who was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doj-holds-press-conference-on-binance-cz-announces-new-ceo.htm">recently appointed CEO of Binance</a> succeeding Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ),Â  said he felt âhumbled and honouredâ to be leading the exchange adding he has seen the user base continue to grow â currently standing at 167 million users.</p>
<p>Speaking about his past role as a regulator he stressed that it is important to support growth as well as manage risk â just focusing on managing risk means the growth dynamic will be overlooked.</p>
<p>âTraditional media still associate crypto and blockchain with scams and illicit funds â but if you look at data issued by the US financial crime office Chainalysis and many other research pieces &#8212; the amount of illicit funds going into crypto is 0.02%,â said Teng.</p>
<p>Teng went on to add he remains bullish regarding crypto and with the Bitcoin Halving coming up and âhopefullyâ with an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-market-could-grow-by-1-trillion-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-cryptoquant-report.htm">ETF being approved in the US</a> more institutions will be entering the space.</p>
<h3><b>Special Guest Buterin Holds Taiwan Employment Gold Card</b></h3>
<p>Buterin spoke at the conference enthusiastically talking through Ethereuamâs pipeline. Ethereum co-founder Buterin has a special relationship with Taiwan having been granted a <a href="https://www.ftvnews.com.tw/news/detail/2023816F10M1">Taiwan Employment Gold Card</a> &#8211; a permit that will allow him to legally reside and work in the country.</p>
<p>Most recently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-plans-to-redesign-ethereum-staking-praises-utxo.htm">Buterin</a>, who introduced a conceptual architecture called the enshrined Zero-Knowledge <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-delays-decision-on-invesco-galaxys-ethereum-etf-until-february-2024.htm">Ethereum</a> Virtual Machine (ZK-EVM) to enhance the main chainâs efficiency has <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/enshrined_zk_evm">blogged</a>, that the proposal of the enshrined <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nil-foundation-launches-type-1-zkevm-for-scalability-on-ethereum.htm">ZK-EVM</a> is aimed at integrating advanced cryptographic techniques directly into Ethereumâs main chain. By doing so, it seeks to provide a more secure and efficient verification process for Ethereum transactions. Specifically, it intends to improve and optimize the operation of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-layer-2-blast-closes-in-on-solana-after-reaching-600-million-tvl-in-10-days.htm">Layer-2</a> applications.</p>
<h3><b>What Bear Market?</b></h3>
<p>With stands full of cakes and freebies, and human sized neon yellow Pikachuâs roaming around the conference centre in Taiwan â it certainly didnât feel like a bear market. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-fomc-optimism-spot-etf-buzz-lift-btc-to-42750.htm">price of Bitcoin has soared</a> to $42,777, marking a significant 4% increase on Thursday. This rally is buoyed by a wave of optimism following the Federal Reserveâs latest FOMC meeting, which indicated a dovish stance on future rate hikes, and sparked lively discussions on the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, with investment giant BlackRock interpreting the minutes as a âgreen light for investors.â</p>
<p>David Tng, managing director of TZ APAC, which is Asia&#8217;s leading Tezos blockchain Incubator told Cryptonews there is an excellent turnout ths year. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Iâve been very impressed at how Taipei Blockchain Week has grown. The event has gathered leaders and innovators from all walks of the industry, from Layer 1 blockchain entities to startups making a real-world impactâ.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tng who is based in Singapore and flew to Taipie for the event â and sees Taipei Blockchain Week as an excellent opportunity to network explaining that the Taiwanese artists and projects he has met are great symbols of the innovation he is seeing in the region.</p>
<p>âThe akaSwap team was one of the startups that really caught my eye with their unique gamification approach they take when building their products,&#8221; said Tng.</p>
<p>Day 2 of the event continues tomorrow.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Enshrined ZK-EVM on Layer-1</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The key idea of an enshrined ZK-EVM is to provide a native, in-protocol system for verifying Ethereum blocks using Zero-Knowledge Proofs. This system aims to reduce dependency on external codebases and minimize risks associated with bugs in these external systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;This situation is suboptimal, because these projects are replicating a functionality that already exists in the Ethereum protocol,&#8221; explained Buterin. The enshrined ZK-EVM would essentially perform similar functions as the current Layer-1 Ethereum blocks but with enhanced security and efficiency. &#8220;The most important property, in addition to basic guarantees of correct functionality and security, is speed.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_142081" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142081" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-142081" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702546071-zk-evm.jpg" alt="ZK-EVM" width="1200" height="602" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702546071-zk-evm.jpg 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702546071-zk-evm-300x151.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702546071-zk-evm-1024x514.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702546071-zk-evm-768x385.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702546071-zk-evm-150x75.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-142081" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Vitalik Buterin</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the significant aspects of this proposal is the compatibility with Ethereum&#8217;s multi-client philosophy. Buterin emphasized the importance of supporting different clients with varying proving systems.</p>
<p>âCompatibility with Ethereumâs multi-client philosophy&#8230;means that we want to avoid enshrining a single proving system, and instead allow different clients to use different proving systems,â said Buterin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Buterin discusses the importance of ensuring data availability and auditability within this system. He argued that any execution proven by the ZK-EVM must guarantee that the underlying data is accessible for inspection in case of issues. This transparency is crucial for maintaining trust and reliability in the network.</p>
<h2>Key Terms and Concepts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To better understand the context of enshrined Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, it&#8217;s essential to clarify some key terms and concepts:</p>
<p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs): These are cryptographic methods that allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. In the context of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-plans-to-verify-identities-of-its-1-4-billion-residents-through-blockchain-based-platform.htm">blockchain</a>, ZK-Proofs enable the verification of transactions while preserving privacy and reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored.</p>
<p>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): The EVM operates as a decentralized global-scale computer, within which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts exist and interact. Every transaction or smart contract executed on Ethereum is processed through the EVM, functioning as the central executor of all network activities.</p>
<p>Layer 2 Solutions: These are technologies built on top of a blockchain (known as Layer 1) to improve its scalability and efficiency. Layer 2 solutions, like rollups or state channels, handle transactions off the main chain but still derive security from the underlying Layer 1 blockchain.</p>

<p>The U.S. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-finally-serves-hex-founder-richard-heart-with-lawsuit-alleging-fraud.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) has postponed its decision on Invesco Galaxy&#8217;s spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cambridge-study-ethereum-consumes-28x-less-energy-than-american-express.htm">Ethereum</a> exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, with a new decision to be made in 2024.</p>
<p>According to the SECâs <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2023/34-99151.pdf">latest filing</a>, the decision, initially expected by December 23, 2023, has been delayed to allow the Commission more time to review the proposal. The new deadline is Feb. 6, 2024.</p>
<p>âThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,â wrote the SEC in the filing.</p>
<p>The SEC has designated the new deadline âas the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.â</p>
<h2>Trend of Ethereum ETF Applications</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In September, Invesco and Galaxy Digital filed the form for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/invesco-galaxy-pursue-spot-ether-etf-application.htm">application</a> of the spot Ethereum ETF. According to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1995569/000119312523246762/d470525ds1.htm">S-1 registration statement</a>, their ETF aims to âreflect the performance of the spot price of etherâ by holding units of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-december-13-fetch-ai-neo-cosmos.htm">crypto</a> with a separate custodian.</p>
<p>As of today, major financial institutions including BlackRock, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ark-invest-dumps-nearly-13-million-in-gbtc-shares-amid-broader-market-sell-off.htm">ARK</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-calls-for-comments-on-fidelitys-spot-ether-etf-application.htm">Fidelity</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-in-q1-and-bitcoin-price-all-time-high-in-q4-vaneck-predictions-2024.htm">VanEck</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-seeks-public-feedback-for-franklin-templeton-and-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">Hashdex</a> have filed spot Ethereum ETF applications with the SEC, all pending final decisions.</p>
<h2>SEC Holds Meetings with Major Bitcoin ETF Issuers</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/four-major-bitcoin-etf-issuers-have-met-with-sec-in-last-few-days-bloomberg-analyst.htm">Recent filings</a> indicated that the SEC has been meeting with major <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-falls-7-in-7-days-time-to-buy-the-dip.htm">Bitcoin</a> ETF issuers and including BlackRock, Grayscale, Franklin, and Fidelity. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-holds-meetings-with-grayscale-blackrock-on-bitcoin-etfs.htm">meetings</a> have brought renewed momentum to the discussion of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals.</p>
<p>With the SEC set to make a decision on BlackRockâs application by mid-January, these discussions are critical. The repeated engagements and strategic amendments to applications, such as BlackRock&#8217;s inclusion of cash purchases for new fund shares, reflect a concerted effort to align with regulatory expectations.</p>
<p>Seyffart suggests that the SEC might consider simultaneous approvals for multiple applications to ensure a level playing field among competitors. As the SEC&#8217;s review process continues, the crypto community awaits what could be a landmark decision in the history of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The supply of Ether has hit a new low since the historic Shanghai upgrade of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> network, witnessing a decline of more than 309,500 coins since September last year.Â </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According toÂ </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://ultrasound.money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">data from Ultra Sound Money</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, nearly 1.195 million ETH have been burned since the transition to the Proof of Stake consensus on September 15, 2022.Â </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The burn rate has outpaced new Ether issuance by approximately 30%, with the network issuing around 885,000 ETH as staking rewards during the same period.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ETH&#8217;s current supply stands 56,000 ETH lower than its recent peak of around 120.27 million on October 31.Â </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The decrease represents an 18% reduction in Ethereum&#8217;s supply since the Shanghai upgrade over the past six weeks.Â </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The recent surge in burned ETH can be attributed to increased on-chain trading, primarily driven by the growing adoption of trading bots.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Uniswap transactions have been the largest contributor to burned ETH in the last 30 days, accounting for approximately 10% of the total ETH destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notably, prominent public trading bots such as Maestro and Banana Gun have ranked among the top burning entities on the network, collectively burning around 9% of the ETH removed from circulation in the past month.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How Shanghai Upgrade Made Ethereum Deflationary?</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/shanghai-update-helped-ethereums-price-collateral-network-could-see-35x-gains-2023.htm">Shanghai upgrade</a>, also known as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/merges-long-term-impact-ethereum.htm">The Merge</a>, aimed to make Ethereum a deflationary network by replacing Proof of Work miners and revamping its tokenomics.Â </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The upgrade resulted in a significant reduction of new Ether issuance, making the network deflationary through the burning of base transaction fees.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Following the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum demonstrated the potential for deflationary behavior, with the supply peaking at nearly 120.534 million ETH three weeks later.Â </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The burn rate accelerated in early 2023, leading to a decrease of approximately 276,500 ETH between February 1 and June 8.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although the burn rate slowed down in the third quarter, the supply of ETH continued to decrease until reaching a post-merge low of around 120.2 million ETH on August 31, effectively offsetting inflation by 307,370 ETH.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notably, throughout September and October, the supply of Ether turned inflationary for the first time in 2023, with approximately 53,700 coins added to ETH&#8217;s supply.Â </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nevertheless, Ethereum&#8217;s on-chain activity experienced a resurgence in November, driven by bullish market conditions, resulting in a significant acceleration in the burn rate.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">AsÂ </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-transaction-fees-outpace-ethereum-defi-tvl-surges-11-in-november-binance.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the recent bull run has led to an uptick in DeFi volumes including the rapid movement of institutional funds into digital asset products.Â </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Overall, total value locked (TVL) across DeFi platforms has surged 11% in the past 30 days with Solana (</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SOL</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">) registering a 56% increase.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This year, Solana has been described as an institutional investor favorite after weeks of record inflows even when altcoin figures were at a record low.Â </span></p>

<p>A pillar of Ethereum&#8217;s original vision was decentralizationâthe idea that its blockchain would operate outside constraints from centralized entities like governments and corporations. Recent data indicates this ideology is being tested, however, as key Ethereum players increasingly censor transactions linked to US sanctions.</p>
<h2>The Turn Toward Censorship</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A major turning point came last year whenÂ the US Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/federal-court-supports-sanctions-tornado-cash-crypto-mixer-despite-user-protest.htm">(OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash</a>, an Ethereum mixing service that enabled private transactions. OFAC claimed the tool was utilized by terrorists and other illicit actors.</p>
<p>In response, Tornado Cash&#8217;s code was added to the same <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">US blacklist containing bad actors like North Korea and Hamas</a>. Supporters <a href="https://forum.dfinity.org/t/tornado-cash-is-banned-how-will-it-affect-spinner-cash/14768">decried the targeting</a> of Tornado Cash as government overreach and censorship. Ethereum has not proven immune, however.</p>

<p>In recent months, censorship of transactions tied to US sanctions has markedly increased on Ethereum, according to <a href="https://censorship.pics/">new research<u></u> from Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni WahrstÃ¤tter</a>. A metric measuring âcensoredâ blocks on Ethereum surged from around 25% in November 2022 to approximately 72% currently.</p>
<p>This spike stems largely from block builders, who assemble transactions into blocks and <a href="https://mevboost.pics/">provide them to validators</a> to add to Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain. Five major block builders now contribute over 90% of Ethereum blocks. Of those, only one major builder, <a href="https://www.titanbuilder.xyz/">Titan Builder</a>, claims it does not filter transactions in this manner.</p>
<p>The lone block builder still processing all transactions claims over 20% of blocks. If Titan began engaging in censorship as well, per WahrstÃ¤tter&#8217;s analysis, overall Ethereum censorship could immediately jump to over 90%. Such reliance on a few builders contradicts the decentralized ethos blockchain promised.</p>

<h2>Impacts on Ethereum&#8217;s Core Values</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For many in the Ethereum community, such censorship represents a betrayal of the network&#8217;s founding principles. The technology&#8217;s decentralized appeal rests on it being uncontrolled and unfettered by real-world biases. Yet block builders now hold immense power over which transactions end up on Ethereum, granting them the power to selectively exclude addresses flagged by OFAC.</p>
<p>Some builders defend this censorship as merely <a href="https://twitter.com/Zach_Glass/status/1557397894210232322">prudent compliance with US regulations</a>. However, critics argue it sets a dangerous precedent of centralized entities overriding Ethereum&#8217;s core coding to meet external rules. It also limits full access to the blockchain for individuals sanctioned by the US government.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">F2Pool was filtering (censoring) OFAC Bitcoin transactions recently and everyone got mad and then they stopped almost immediately. </p>
<p>Can Ethereum do the same with censoring builders? As in, just ask that they stop. Like is this a corollary would you say or no? <a href="https://t.co/6NUBmoEWuF">pic.twitter.com/6NUBmoEWuF</a></p>

Beyond censorship, the centralization of key transaction functions into a few dominant <a href="https://protos.com/ethereum-centralization-is-becoming-a-serious-problem/">block builders could pose security risks</a>, according to experts. Further, these players gain privileged access to pending transaction data, potentially allowing them to maximize profits through trading strategies before transactions are added to the blockchain. This raises additional questions about fairness and transparency.</p>
<p>Ethereum was designed as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/decentralized-social-network-friendtech-surpasses-1-million-in-24-hour-fees-leaving-uniswap-and-bitcoin-behind.htm">decentralized network</a> not beholden to external constraints. Block builders processing transactions increasingly censor addresses tied to US sanctions, however, calling Ethereum&#8217;s decentralization into question. While some view this censorship as prudent legal compliance, critics see it as contradicting Ethereum&#8217;s core values.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, Ethereum&#8217;s leadership is exploring ways to curb censorship trends. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/09/vitalik-buterins-new-ethereum-roadmap-takes-aim-at-mev-and-censorship/">Vitalik Buterin has proposed updates</a> that inhibit transaction blocking by validators and builders.</p>
<p>This challenge to Ethereum&#8217;s decentralized ethos may prove to be a defining one, forcing the community to confront difficult questions about the limits and future direction of the technology. The answers could shape Ethereum&#8217;s ability to evolve while retaining the core principles on which it was founded.</p>

<p>The U.S. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-pushes-for-judge-to-classify-crypto-as-securities-in-terraform-labs-case-bypassing-jury.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) has postponed its decision on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-positions-itself-for-bitcoin-etf-race-with-hire-of-former-invesco-head-john-hoffman.htm">Grayscale</a>&#8216;s application for its spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-ethereum-etf-plans-spur-on-bitcoin-etf-token-investors-to-take-last-chance-to-buy-at-low-0-005-price.htm">Ethereum exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF), extending the review period with a new deadline set for January 2024.</p>
<p>According to the SECâs <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2023/34-99082.pdf">latest filing</a>, the commission has now designated Jan. 25, 2024, as the new deadline to replace the previous due date of Dec. 11, 2023. The filing stated that this postponement is to allow a longer period for comprehensive consideration of the proposed rule change and the issues it entails.</p>
<h2>SEC Postpones Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum ETF Decision</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In their explanation, the SEC wrote, &#8220;The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.&#8221;</p>
<p>By Jan. 25, the SEC âthe Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapproveâ Grayscaleâs proposed spot Ethereum ETF application.</p>
<p>The ongoing scrutiny by the SEC over <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-december-5-stacks-conflux-kucoin.htm">crypto</a>-based ETFs, including both Ethereum and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/btc-price-to-hit-50k-soon-as-traders-rush-to-buy-up-bitcoin-etf-btcetf-token-after-successful-2-5-million-raise.htm">Bitcoin</a>, underscores the cautious stance of the regulatory body towards integrating these digital assets into mainstream financial products. This extended deadline for Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum ETF is a continuation of the SEC&#8217;s pattern of diligently assessing the viability and impact of such investment choices in the U.S. market.</p>
<h2>Meetings and More Delayed Decisions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The SEC has been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-holds-meetings-with-grayscale-blackrock-on-bitcoin-etfs.htm">holding meetings</a> with major financial institutions that have filed for their crypto ETFs, including Grayscale and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-and-bitwise-update-bitcoin-etf-filings-with-sec.htm">BlackRock</a>. A memorandum published by the SEC indicated that officials from the agencyâs Division of Trading and Markets met with Grayscale Investments on Nov. 29 to consider the proposed conversion of Grayscaleâs listed Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>Previously, the SEC has delayed its decisions on numerous ETF filings, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/global-xs-bitcoin-etf-decision-delayed-by-sec-new-deadline-set-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Global X</a>âs, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-seeks-public-feedback-for-franklin-templeton-and-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">Franklin Templeton</a>âs, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-postpones-decision-on-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etf-and-grayscale-ether-etf.htm">Hashdex</a>âs.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Commission has not yet approved any spot Bitcoin or Ethereum ETF applications for listing on a U.S. exchange. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, the postponement is âcompletely normal.â Seyffart believed that once the authority decides to finally approve a crypto ETF, multiple applications can be approved simultaneously.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWaNej58Wn0">interview with the NFT platform Defiant</a> during his visit to Turkey, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tackled the issue of staking centralization within the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>Buterin highlighted the necessity to revamp Ethereum&#8217;s staking mechanism to foster healthier mining and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-staking-platforms.htm">staking pools</a>, ultimately aiming to enhance the overall decentralization of the platform.</p>
<p>The proposed initiative comes as a response to the challenges posed by the sluggish movement of data availability in off-chain systems, primarily attributed to the high demands in the near-term and mid-term.</p>
<h2>Vitalik Shares Dankshrading Details</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Addressing an imminent upgrade in the Ethereum ecosystem, Buterin shed light on EIP 4844, commonly known as Danksharding.</p>
<p>This upgrade is poised to enhance the data map space, increasing it to 16 Megabytes per slot. The post-upgrade phase will involve configuring parameters and attributes to refine Ethereum&#8217;s scalability and efficiency.</p>
<p>In a shift toward a more democratic and less disruptive process, Buterin proposed the implementation of a voting system to govern future changes on the Ethereum network, potentially eliminating the need for hard forks. This strategic move aligns with Ethereum&#8217;s continuous evolution to address scalability challenges.</p>
<p>The Dencun upgrade, a crucial element in Ethereum&#8217;s roadmap, is expected to go live in early 2024. This upgrade aims to play a pivotal role in improving Ethereum&#8217;s scalability, efficiency, and decentralization.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Founder Praises UTxO Payment Model</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
During the interview, Buterin also explored the possibility of adopting the Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO) approach, a model utilized by blockchains such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">Bitcoin</a> and Cardano. This consideration reflects Ethereum&#8217;s openness to diverse approaches in addressing existing challenges within its network.</p>
<p>While Buterin&#8217;s proposals generated discussions within the crypto community, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson responded with a touch of sarcasm, stating, &#8220;No worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>In a new chapter of the ETHGate saga, Steven Nerayoff&#8217;s attorney, Michael Scotto, said they have ample evidence to back up forthcoming lawsuits againstÂ the US Government and additional private actors, as well as whistleblower filings that they intend to release, some of which will implicate major players in Ethereum&#8217;s early days.</p>
<p>In an interview with Cryptonews.com, Scotto detailed how they plan to counter the &#8220;false narrative&#8221; surrounding his client with factual revelations in the lawsuits, which will be filed in New York State and Federal Courts.</p>
<p>Steven Nerayoff, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/countdown-to-ethereum-expose-insider-promises-proof-of-vitalik-buterins-alleged-fraud-in-48-hours.htm">an early Ethereum insider</a>, spent years battling government accusations of extortion before finally getting charges dismissed earlier this year. He is now seeking legal recourse.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Scotto asserted that Nerayoff harbors no ill will toward Ethereum itself, which he still wants to see prosper, portraying Nerayoff as pro-crypto and pro-Ethereum philosophically. Nerayoff takes issue with how the project took shape and has objections over particular actions by specific leaders, however, he said.</p>
<p>While the validity of Nerayoff&#8217;s claims is still unconfirmed, Scotto said the forthcoming lawsuits will likely include charges of malicious prosecution and breach of contract over hundreds of millions in unpaid deals and that the whistleblower fillings will relate specifically to ETHGate.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nerayoff-follows-through-releases-2015-vitalik-buterin-recordings-detailing-ethereum-corruption-whats-going-on.htm">As was seen in the recording Nerayoff published last week</a>, he provided key strategic guidance to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 2015 on tackling mounting structural, legal, and financial problems.</p>
<p>An X post on November 15 from Nerayoff also hinted at the possibility of fraud being in the mix of allegations that will be revealed in the lawsuits.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recording isnât directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was really happening &amp; show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit,&#8221; he wrote in the post.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Though recognizing the need for change, Buterin seemed reluctant to make necessary choices in the recording. <a href="https://altura-marketplace-1.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Restructuring+Plan+Rough+Outline+Final.pdf">A restructuring plan</a> was also proposed but never fully implemented.</p>
<h2>Steven Nerayoff Exonerated After Years Defending Against Charges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Scotto explained that his client was focused entirely on defending himself after the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/two-arrested-extortion-startup-cryptocurrency-company">September 2019 arrest</a> until finally getting the government to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/15/us-prosecutors-drop-extortion-charges-against-early-adviser-to-ethereum-network/#:~:text=10%20Years%20of%20Decentralizing%20the%20Future&amp;text=Criminal%20extortion%20charges%20against%20Steven,he%20made%20against%20U.S.%20investigators.">dismiss charges</a>. According to Scotto, Nerayoff felt fighting for his life and reputation against wrongful allegations took priority over releasing the recordings of himself and Buterin earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not an exaggeration to say [he was] fighting for his life, and frankly we were only able to go on the offensive this past February when we filed our motion to dismiss,â Scotto said. âThe case was eventually dismissed on the government&#8217;s motion because our motion proved they knew he was innocent and charged him anyway, and they ignored that evidence and simply said &#8216;Oh yeah, we can&#8217;t prove his guilt.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Now exonerated, Steven Nerayoff is going on the offense against parties he believes took advantage of the situation. Scotto said Nerayoff sat in court for years until he could fully clear his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea was to kind of coordinate those (the recordings and lawsuits)&#8230; And so that&#8217;s coming shortly,â Scotto told Cryptonews.com. â&#8230;The idea was we would put this out there because when those lawsuits became public, we didn&#8217;t want people to then question who Steve was and what happened.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Steve was innocent and we had the evidence to show the case was fabricated and his alleged co-conspirator was a govt informant. <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JohnEDeaton1</a> commented on the dismissal.  <a href="https://t.co/Tg5ToWsooN">https://t.co/Tg5ToWsooN</a> look to the east soon.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Scotto said that the dismissal of charges against Nerayoff followed revelations that government officials knew he was innocent at least seven months prior to arresting him, and that his alleged co-conspirator was an FBI informant who conned Nerayoff out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<h2>Lawyer Hints at SEC Role in Ethereum Investigation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Scotto said the facts would illuminate &#8220;coincidences between certain events that were going on at the SEC and steps that were being taken&#8221; against Nerayoff. He said one aspect of the lawsuits would deal with &#8220;malicious prosecution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a big one,â he said. âAnd then a couple of breach of contract cases on some of these deals that people basically either took advantage of the situation or [were] a part of creating the situation in order to stiff Steve of literally hundreds of millions of dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scotto said the full sequence of events will make clear that the malicious prosecution occurred.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Within the next few weeks, Nerayoff is planning to releaseÂ the Ethereum whistleblower filings and file the malicious prosecution lawsuit, according to Scotto, who maintained they have ample evidence to back claims of hundreds of millions in damages from broken deals.</p>
<h2>Buterin and Lubin Silent Amid Accusations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ethereum leaders have so far been publicly silent amid the bold accusations of shady activities. Scottor said he finds this lack of denial telling given the nature of the allegations.</p>
<p>He added that Nerayoff&#8217;s frustrations also stem from parts of the crypto media declining to cover his exoneration and the questionable circumstances around it. He ultimately <a href="https://real-truth.marketplace.alturanft.com/item/137/0x9a5bacd18be44a214515519238c728faec1468e0/1">released the collection of five Buterin recordings</a> directly on the blockchainâdecentralizing itâto get the story out.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Community Faces Moment of Reckoning</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
If true, these latest allegations may present a crisis moment for Ethereum as doubts multiply regarding its origins and Buterin&#8217;s leadership. With the platform aspiring to be a Web3 backbone, this controversy could deepen existing concerns over <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-eth-breaches-2000-resistance-time-to-buy.htm">stagnant Ether prices</a> and developer frustrations.</p>
<p>âIt&#8217;s up to other people to decide, but I think people will be able to judge based on these objective facts and conclusions that they can draw based on those facts,â Scotto said.</p>

<p>Blast, a newly launched Ethereum-based layer 2 network, is already gaining traction in the market after one unidentified whale deposited a massive 10,000 ETH to the network.</p>
<p>The deposit was made on Wednesday this week, just two days after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blur-founder-launches-new-layer-2-network-blast-raises-55-million-within-hours.htm">Blast went live in âearly accessâ mode</a>.</p>
<p>Worth over $20 million in fiat terms by todayâs price, the news of the massive on-chain transaction was shared on social media platform X by the popular community member Farokh.</p>
<p>âSome degen deposited 10,000 ETH into BLAST,â Farokh wrote, seemingly shocked that someone would deposit such a large amount on a newly launched blockchain project.</p>

<h2>Blast went live this week</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Blast was launched by Tieshun âPacmanâ Roquerre, who is also the founder of the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur, on Monday this week.</p>
<p>According to an X post from the team behind the network, the plan is for Blast to become the first Ethereum layer 2 platform to introduce a built-in yield model.</p>
<p>The project raised some $20 million in initial funding, and continued to see on-chain investments in excess of $55 million within hours of its launch.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Blast: The only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Ethereum-based layer 2 networks like Blast have become more popular in recent years, partly thanks to increased transaction fees and slower transactions speeds on Ethereumâs base layer.</p>
<p>According to a report from blockchain intelligence firm Messari from last month, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/layer-2-networks-account-for-nearly-two-thirds-of-ethereum-transactions-report.htm">layer 2 networks now account for nearly two-thirds of all Ethereum transactions</a>.</p>
<p>According to Kunal Goel, a research analyst at Messari, the increased adoption of layer 2 networks in the third quarter of this year is largely a result of theÂ <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/base-network-outstrips-solanas-tvl-as-summer-lull-draws-close.htm">growing adoption of Coinbaseâs layer 2 network Base</a>.</p>
<p>Since the launch of Base in August, it has lived up to its expectations with growing transactions and use cases and temporarily recording more activity than Ethereumâs main network at one point.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/johnrising_/status/1724183263411896749">Data from November 14</a> shows that ERC-4437 has failed to gain meaningful traction among Ethereum developers and users in the months since its launch.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/01/ethereum-activates-account-abstraction-touted-by-founder-buterin-as-key-advance/">ERC-4437 was unveiled in March 2023</a>, many in the Ethereum community were optimistic that these so-called &#8220;smart accounts&#8221; would alter user experiences on Ethereum-compatible blockchains for the better. By allowing assets to be controlled by smart contracts rather than externally owned accounts (EOAs), ERC-4437 was supposed to make transactions easier and more secure for everyday users.</p>
<h2>Adoption Falters Despite Ethereum Compatibility</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.bundlebear.com/overview/all">According to figures from BundleBear</a>, an account abstraction data analytics platform, both usage and retention of these smart accounts have been underwhelming so far. Only 6.89% of initial smart accounts created have remained active for over six months. The average ERC-4437-enabled account has also only conducted five transactions in total.</p>
<p>The poor user engagement comes despite ERC-4437&#8217;s touted <a href="https://fassko.medium.com/understanding-erc-4337-and-the-future-of-ethereum-user-experience-account-abstraction-4992227bab35">benefits of bypassing seed phrases and simplifying transactions</a>. The standard was designed specifically to make Ethereum more user-friendly, but its sluggish pickup indicates those user experience goals have not yet materialized.</p>
<p>In addition, core infrastructure providers enabling the functionality have struggled to turn a profit. <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-a-bundler">Bundlers</a>, which allow smart accounts to operate on EVM chains, are largely running at a loss, even with some users accidentally overpaying gas fees.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Retention is terrible.</p>
<p>The one exception to this is CyberConnect, who had a lot of users return to claim an airdrop.</p>
<p>Data: <a href="https://twitter.com/0xBundleBear?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@0xBundleBear</a> <a href="https://t.co/TUzQQJYcp8">pic.twitter.com/TUzQQJYcp8</a></p>
<p>&mdash; John Rising (@johnrising_) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnrising_/status/1724183263411896749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Looking at the data, ERC-4437 advocate John Rising described the adoption figures as &#8220;terrible.&#8221; After its enthusiastic launch and promotion, the standard has so far failed to deliver the promised advancements in Ethereum user experience.</p>
<h2>Will ERC-4437 Eventually Catch Fire on Ethereum?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Some in the Ethereum community urge patience with ERC-4437. <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hardly-anyone-using-ethereum-smart-accounts">Jesse Pollak, protocol lead at Coinbase</a>, argued adoption of new standards happens gradually before reaching an inflection point. The growth of ERC-4437 may seem slow now but could suddenly accelerate as more developers build supporting infrastructure.</p>
<p>August 2023 saw the most active ERC-4437 wallets in a month, with over 420,000 across seven blockchains. While this number declined to 143,000 in October, it still indicates steady initial adoption. For a standard launched in 2023, Pollak contended ERC-4437 uptake remains healthy even if below initial expectations.</p>
<p>The coming months will be crucial in determining if ERC-4437 delivers on its promise to improve user experiences on Ethereum. For now, the reality is that adoption stays muted. But Ethereumâs history shows community standards like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/ethereum-how-erc-20-erc-725-unlocked-the-tokenization-of-everything.htm">ERC-20 took time to gain traction</a> too before transforming the ecosystem. ERC-4437 advocates are still betting this latest standard will eventually catch on in similar fashion.</p>

<p>According to blockchain analytics provider IntoTheBlock, Ethereum saw $320 million in exchange outflows just this week. Over the preceding three weeks, the total topped $1 billion.</p>
<h2><strong>Ethereum Exchange Outflows Inspire Long-Term Industry Confidence</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Massive exchange outflows frequently signal traders are moving assets into secure storage for an extended investment horizon rather than keeping them on an exchange for active trading. Some experts contend the withdrawals reflect improving sentiment around Ethereum&#8217;s long-term trajectory as investors choose storage over liquidation.</p>
<p>Ethereum is currently hovering around $2,019, up 0.40% over the last 24 hours <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSDT/">according to TradingView</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-and-ethereum-networks-see-heightened-fees-as-crypto-usage-soars.htm">Trading volumes and volatility have also picked up recently across decentralized apps and protocols</a>, driving up transaction fees on the network.</p>
<h2><strong>Mainstream Ethereum Access Through ETH ETFs</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In parallel, more traditional finance players are looking to grant mainstream investors exposure to Ethereum&#8217;s price movements.</p>

<p>Asset management powerhouse Fidelity is the latest to join the race for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would hold the underlying cryptocurrency rather than futures contracts. A Friday filing with Cboe Global Markets is seeking approval for the Fidelity Ethereum ETF.</p>
<p>This adds to a string of similar <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-ethereum-etf-styled-ethetf-token-starts-mammoth-burn-program-price-to-pump-10x.htm">Ethereum ETF</a> applications from competitors like BlackRock. But thus far, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/global-xs-bitcoin-etf-decision-delayed-by-sec-new-deadline-set-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission has punted decisions</a> on Ethereum ETFs to 2024.</p>
<p>Industry analysts remain optimistic the regulator will eventually greenlight spot Ethereum ETFs, however, treating the asset similarly to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In any case, if an ETF does go through, this will open the crypto up to the $7.4 trillion US ETF marketplace and could significantly expand access for regular investors beyond the hassles of directly holding cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The crypto community has been rocked by allegations of Ethereum corruption and fraud stemming from co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Last week, early Ethereum <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/countdown-to-ethereum-expose-insider-promises-proof-of-vitalik-buterins-alleged-fraud-in-48-hours.htm">insider Steven Nerayoff promised to disclose recordings</a> from 2015 that would expose fraudulent activities by Buterin during Ethereum&#8217;s troubled early days. Today, Nerayoff followed through, releasing five conversations between himself and Buterin, as well as a proposed &#8220;Rescue &amp; Restructure Plan&#8221; for the organization from 2015.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/StevenNerayoff/status/1724994597049278515?t=DPxAQKMs591Yv13O4rDEmA&amp;s=19">In an X post today</a>, Nerayoff clarified, &#8220;The recording isnât directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was really happening &amp; show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://real-truth.marketplace.alturanft.com/item/137/0x9a5bacd18be44a214515519238c728faec1468e0/1">The recordings provide unprecedented insight</a> into Ethereum&#8217;s shaky beginnings, portraying a young Buterin seeking guidance from Nerayoff on navigating mounting challenges. They reveal flaws in Ethereum&#8217;s structure, decision-making, and leadership in its critical formative stages. If substantiated, these revelations could irreparably damage Buterin&#8217;s reputation and the public&#8217;s confidence in Ethereum as doubts grow about its long-term viability.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">Ether prices</a> still lagging below 2022 highs amidst this controversy, the stakes are sky-high. While the validity of Nerayoff&#8217;s evidence still needs to be thoroughly vetted in the coming days, the immediate fallout highlights the need for radical transparency, sound judgment, and clear communication. These are essential pillars for any <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guide_categories/blockchain/">blockchain</a> project eyeing mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>For Ethereum, the path forward no doubt requires restoring community trust, preventing fragmentation, and implementing strategies focused on platform stability rather than short-term gains.</p>

<h2>Summary and Analysis of the Buterin-Nerayoff Conversations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The conversations between Steven Nerayoff and Vitalik Buterin in 2015 cover a wide range of organizational issues plaguing Ethereum in its early stages. Nerayoff plays the role of an advisor, assessing <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/29/the-most-pressing-issue-on-ethereum-is-validator-size-growth/">Ethereum&#8217;s deficiencies</a> and proposing major changes to ensure its viability.</p>
<p>A key area of concern highlighted in the recordings was Ethereum&#8217;s financial management early on. Specifically, Nerayoff sharply criticized the decision not to hedge Ethereum&#8217;s Bitcoin holdings as Bitcoin&#8217;s price fluctuated wildly in the early days.</p>
<p>As he told Nerayoff, &#8220;There was never a decision made not to hedge. It was just&#8230;I mean basically a really huge amount of inertia is probably the only way you could describe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nerayoff heavily critiqued Buterin in the recordings.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the position wasnât hedged in my opinion is inexcusable. Absolutely inexcusable,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">His white paper was unworkable. Gavin fixed it in his yellow paper &amp; heâs the reason 1.0 got out the door. Vitalik is the reason 2.0 never got out the door. And with developers all on Ethereum being false promised scalability that would never come it held back all of crypto.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h3>Topics Covered</h3>
<p>The discussions touched on several key challenges facing Ethereum, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of operational infrastructure, especially in Switzerland which was vital for administrative functions</li>
<li>Concerns about Ethereum&#8217;s financial decisions, including failure to hedge and speculation on Bitcoin value</li>
<li>Legal and regulatory risks related to money transfers, tax compliance, and promotion of questionable ICOs</li>
<li>Poor internal structure with a lack of clear roles and disjointed teams</li>
<li>Issues with co-founder conduct, communication, and competency</li>
<li>Need for rebranding and improved community outreach</li>
<li>Intense competition in the blockchain landscape</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nerayoff as Advisor on Restructuring</h3>
<p>Throughout the conversations, Nerayoff positioned himself as an advisor guiding Buterin. Looking to Ethereum&#8217;s future leadership, Nerayoff stressed the urgent need for an experienced executive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CEO needs to be able to make calls and if you have a CEO, in this type of company, there can be an interim CEO that we can find that doesnât necessarily need to be deep into the technology, but I think your long term CEO does,&#8221; he advised Buterin.</p>
<p>He provided blunt critiques of Ethereum&#8217;s deficiencies and proposed radical solutions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete operational overhaul involving new executive hires, staff cuts, and redefined roles</li>
<li>Legal and financial audits to identify compliance issues</li>
<li>Relocation of the entire operation to Switzerland</li>
<li>Creation of a new for-profit entity alongside the existing foundation</li>
<li>Rebranding and marketing campaign focused on developers</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;You have to decide first of all whether or not youâre willing to do what it takes here. You have to decide whether or not the organization is more important than any individual, &#8221; Nerayoff told Buterin during their conversation.</p>
<h3>Buterin Seeking Solutions</h3>
<p>In their conversations, Buterin acknowledged Ethereum&#8217;s precarious situation and the merit of Nerayoff&#8217;s proposals but seemed uncertain about how to implement the major changes required.</p>
<p>Buterin also admitted to mistakes in financial decisions and a lack of assertiveness in managing the team, deferring frequently to Nerayoff for strategic advice.</p>
<p>In assessing his leadership skills, Buterin said in the recordings, &#8220;If I had to describe my faults it would be, I was basically trying to abdicate responsibility the whole time.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Examination of the &#8216;Rescue &amp; Restructure Plan&#8217;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The &#8220;<a href="https://altura-marketplace-1.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Restructuring+Plan+Rough+Outline+Final.pdf">Rescue &amp; Restructure Plan</a>&#8221; outlined by Nerayoff in 2015 provides further insight into the changes he proposed for getting Ethereum back on track. The plan called for a relocation to Switzerland, an executive and staff overhaul, a focus on legal and financial compliance, structural changes, and marketing and branding changes. Details for each category include:</p>
<h3>Relocation to Switzerland</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/06/27/zug-where-ethereum-was-born-and-crypto-goes-to-grow-up/">Move all operations to Switzerland</a> to centralize control and meet legal obligations</li>
<li>Eliminate involvement of &#8220;disconnected&#8221; co-founders resistant to relocating</li>
<li>Renegotiate agreements between Swiss entity and related parties</li>
</ul>
<h3>Executive and Staff Overhaul</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire experienced CFO and COO to provide &#8220;adult supervision&#8221;</li>
<li>Terminate or reassign co-founders and staff causing issues</li>
<li>Reduce salaries and offer equity compensation</li>
<li>Incentivize a recruiter to build out the team</li>
</ul>
<p>Though recognizing the need for change, Buterin appeared reluctant to make tough staffing choices.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have to bump up against people, I will, but the thing is, this is one issue I have. Itâs exactly the issue that Iâve already said in our calls today a couple of times: basically, these Maltese (unknown) people are cool,&#8221; he told Nerayoff in the recordings.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h3>Legal and Financial Compliance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Conduct an independent audit of all financial accounts</li>
<li>Review for compliance issues with securities, tax, and money transfer laws</li>
<li>Eliminate promotional involvement with questionable ICOs</li>
<li>Archive and annotate all communications for transparency</li>
</ul>
<h3>Structural Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Streamline roles and operations based on consultant review</li>
<li>Consolidate fragmented teams and entities</li>
<li>Launch dedicated teams for initiatives like DAO creation</li>
<li>Consider bringing back <a href="https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/why-charles-hoskinson-was-shamefully-kicked-out-of-ethereum-8b29faa5cd14">exiled strategic thinkers like Charles Hoskinson</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buterin also admitted the aimlessness at Ethereum&#8217;s core during their conversations, saying &#8220;Right now, Ethereum isnât really a company, itâs more of an idea, coupled with a nonprofit organization that happens to have some quantity of money attached to it thatâll last us another year.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Branding and Marketing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete rebranding and marketing reset</li>
<li>Showcase successful dApps and create developer support tools</li>
<li>Spotlight Buterin&#8217;s personal brand and technical strengths</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the proposed overhaul sought to remedy a wide array of intertwined issues that threatened the foundation&#8217;s survival.</p>
<h2>Impact on Ethereum&#8217;s Reputation and Market Value</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The release of the Buterin recordings and restructuring plan has generated intense discussion within the Ethereum community. Many see it as confirmation of long-held doubts about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pulsechain/comments/173wf24/so_vitalik_buterin_just_dumped_a_1700_eth_for_27/">Buterin&#8217;s competency</a> during the platform&#8217;s origins. Caution should be exercised until a more rigorous examination of the evidence can be conducted.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/ethereum-2-0-is-a-great-big-lie-593b46bcae56">Buterin has already faced growing criticism</a> in recent years as the price of Ether stagnated. His <a href="https://www.tronweekly.com/vitalik-buterin-faces-devastating-allegations/">reputation as a visionary thought leader</a> has steadily declined in some peoples&#8217; eyes.</p>
<p>The controversy also comes at a time when frustration was already high over Ethereum&#8217;s failure to reach new price highs. The price of Ether has trended downward through the year despite broader cryptocurrency gains. It continues lagging well below its all-time highs, even as competitors like <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">Solana</a> make inroads.</p>
<p>Adding to the woes are signs that the public&#8217;s trust in Ethereum may be fracturing. The risk of splinter groups forming hard forks from the main chain has grown as criticisms mount. Without restored faith in Ethereum&#8217;s leadership and direction, its cohesion could be in danger. This new alleged corruption and its unflattering portrait of ineptitude only accelerates the erosion.</p>
<p>Following the release of recordings, Ethereum&#8217;s price crashed by 4.70% and is currently trading at $1,962.68.</p>

<p>While the long-term ramifications remain uncertain, the immediate impact is clearly detrimental for Ethereum. For a platform aspiring to be the backbone of Web3, these are significant setbacks on the road to mainstream adoption.</p>
<h2>Is Ethereum Safe?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The ramifications of the latest Ethereum scandal remain to be fully determined, but the risks for Ethereum are clearly huge. Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation will need to promptly and thoroughly address the allegations if they hope to mitigate the damage.</p>
<p>A point-by-point examination of the evidence presented by Nerayoff is critical. Any confirmed improprieties or incompetence by leadership should be transparently acknowledged. Swift action may be required, potentially including Buterin&#8217;s resignation or removal depending on the severity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember this video when I drop the recording &amp; what I tell Vitalik about 2.0 and to fix misaligned incentive structures.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Restoring public trust will be a monumental challenge for Ethereum. A coherent communications strategy is needed to soothe concerns over <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-13/ethereum-s-volatility-is-undermining-its-viability">Ethereum&#8217;s stability and viability</a> for the long term. The community must be reassured that careful steps are being taken to correct course and learn from past mistakes.</p>
<p>From an operational perspective, employing the best talent and making sound technical decisions are also imperative. Ethereum&#8217;s value rests on its capabilities as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ethereum.htm">decentralized platform</a>. Its technological progress must not stall amidst organizational turmoil.</p>
<p>While the public anger elicited by this scandal presents obstacles, it also offers opportunities for improvement. With wise guidance, Ethereum could emerge stronger by replacing ineffective leaders, mending community ties, and refocusing its mission. But without prudence and skillful management of the fallout, the once-bright future of this blockchain pioneer could swiftly dim.</p>

<p>The worldâs largest asset manager, BlackRock, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2000638/000143774923032233/iset20231114_s1.htm">formally filed an application</a> for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-ether.htm">a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund</a> on Wednesday, November 15th.</p>
<h2>A 2% increase</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Filing an S-1 form with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), BlackRock has labeled the exchange-traded fund iShares Ethereum Trust. iShares is the standard name for the asset managerâs exchange-traded fund division.</p>
<p>âThe Shares have been designed to remove the obstacles represented by the complexities and operational burdens involved in a direct investment in ether, while at the same time having an intrinsic value that reflects, at any given time, the investment exposure to the price of ether owned by the Trust at such time, less the Trustâs expenses and liabilities,â the filing states. âAlthough the Shares are not the exact equivalent of a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/how-to-invest-in-ethereum.htm">direct investment in ether</a>, they provide investors with an alternative method of achieving investment exposure to the price of ether through the securities market, which may be more familiar to them.â</p>
<p>News of the filing prompted the price of ether to swiftly increase by 2% to $2,080 before re-stabilizing at its normal price point.Â </p>
<h2>Excitement for ETFs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Earlier this week, an XRP exchange-traded fund application seemingly made by BlackRock made the rounds on social media, spiking XRPâs price by 10%. However, a spokesperson for BlackRock formally denied the rumored application on Monday, November 13th, and the Delaware Department of Justice is currently investigating the matter.</p>
<p>BlackRockâs spot exchange-traded fund application comes shortly after the asset management company filed the iShares Ethereum Trust with the Delaware Department of State Division of Corporations and a filing by Nasdaq for the entity to receive regulatory approval. Coinbase Custody Trust Company has been selected to serve as custodian for the ETF.Â </p>
<p>Meanwhile, BlackRock is simultaneously pursuing a spot Bitcoin ETF alongside twelve other applicants including Grayscale Investments, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, and Invesco Gallery Bitcoin ETF, among others.Â </p>
<h2>What to expect going forward</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bloomberg ETF research analysts, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, previously released data<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/brief-approval-window-opens-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-applicants-90-chance-of-approval-by-january.htm"> showing an eight-day window</a> wherein the SEC could approve a number of spot Bitcoin ETF applicants. However, with the window slated to close on Friday, November 17th, it looks unlikely.Â </p>
<p>Balchunas and Seyffart estimate a 90% chance that spot Bitcoin applicants&#8217; ETF will be approved by January 10th, 2024.</p>
<p>If BlackRockâs spot Ethereum ETF is approved, it could signal a broader interest from more traditional financial firms to position themselves in the crypto space.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, November 15, 2023</i> â A 400% gain for early DEX hunters from <a href="https://ethetftoken.io/">ETHETF Token</a> is fuelling a robust Ethereum ETF narrative in the crypto market after the new token launched on Uniswap yesterday.</p>
<p>$ETHETF launched at 1pm GMT on Tuesday and secured quick 4x gains for the earliest buyers amidst strong liquidity and volume, signaling the possibility of much higher prices to come once news of its arrival gets out and the Ethereum narrative takes further hold of the market.</p>
<p>A little over 24 hours after stealth-launching, $ETHETF â playing off positive sentiment around Ethereum ETF news â reached a market capitalization of over $2 million before finding support around $1.2 million. With $520,000 liquidity â locked in the Uniswap V3 pool for seven days â facilitating smooth trading and minimal price slippage, the token has formed a strong foundation.</p>
<p>The ETHETF Token website states the coinâs intention to be ahead of the curve before BlackRockâs spot ETF is brought to the market, an event that is expected to cause a price explosion for Ethereum (ETH) and all coins associated with it.</p>
<p>To keep abreast of the latest developments in the ETHETF Token project, follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/ETHETFToken">X account</a> and join the <a href="https://t.me/ETHETFToken">ETHETF Telegram</a> group.</p>
<h2>BlackRock starts off massive Ethereum ETF narrative</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Ethereum price broke out towards $2,000 last week following BlackRockâs application for an Ethereum spot ETF, but market watchers have now found another way to play this move.Â </p>
<p>For traders, Ethereumâs price has reached historical resistance at the $ 2,000 mark, and staying above this level was a requirement for many analysts to increase their bullish sentiment for altcoins.</p>
<p>Several prominent altcoins have seen price increases as much as 100% or more recently as capital rotates from Bitcoin to Ethereum to larger cap alts. Key to sustaining this pump was the bullish BlackRock news for Ethereum.</p>
<p>As the positive market sentiment surrounding the likelihood of a Bitcoin spot ETF being approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reaches fever pitch, the hype around a possible Ethereum ETF is only beginning.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin (BTC) surging 42% from a sticking point around $26,000 all the way up to $37,000 upon the news that the SEC has an option to approve all 12 pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications within a current 8-day window, capital now appears to be moving from BTC to other crypto assets.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) spiked from $1,800 to close to $2,100 when the BlackRock ETF news was released, only a 16% move, and should be expected to keep going as more details come out regarding this development.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-131986" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700081555-ethetf-2.png" alt="" width="512" height="244" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700081555-ethetf-2.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700081555-ethetf-2-300x143.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700081555-ethetf-2-130x63.png 130w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700081555-ethetf-2-104x50.png 104w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700081555-ethetf-2-83x40.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<h2>Ethereumâs bullish narrative continues in 2023/24</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
During the last bear market in 2022, Ethereum stood firm compared to other assets, thanks in no small part to The Merge â an event that transitioned Ethereum from a proof-of-work protocol to proof-of-stake.</p>
<p>This event, also known as the âShangellaâ upgrade, announced Ethereum as a greener blockchain with enormous passive income opportunities due to the ease of being able to stake ETH 2.0 without expensive and complicated mining equipment.</p>
<p>Ethereum stayed strong throughout the bear market and bounced back well above its previous bull cycle all-time high of $1,400 thanks to hype around The Merge, while Bitcoin dropped below its $19,000 previous ATH for a good while. This set a strong foundation for bullish developments to take the ETH price higher in 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p>And while Ethereum has underperformed compared to Bitcoin in 2023, the news that the largest financial asset manager in the world â with trillions of dollars managed on its books â intends to offer a spot ETF for Ethereum could open the floodgates for the largest altcoin.</p>
<h2>Why Ethereum is the new silver</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The excitement surrounding ETFs for Bitcoin is for good reason, and gold is often referenced as a precedent of what could happen when a spot ETF is eventually approved and launched. Gold was mainly being traded by institutions before a spot Gold ETF opened the market to retail investors.Â </p>
<p>Gold skyrocketed nearly 350% after the first Gold ETF was approved in the US in 2004, and something similar is expected to happen for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Enter Ethereum, which is the silver to Bitcoinâs digital gold. As the second-largest and most-trusted crypto asset outside of Bitcoin, a spot ETF for Ethereum would put the newly bonafide âdigital silverâ into the largest portfolios and launch the currency into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>Assuming BlackRockâs spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved, it should only be a matter of time before its spot Ethereum ETF is also launched to the market. The knock-on effect of that will be substantial as other financial firms launch their own Ethereum ETFs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-131987" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700081618-ethetf-3.png" alt="" width="512" height="291" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700081618-ethetf-3.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1700081618-ethetf-3-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<h2>Savvy traders view ETHETF Token as the intelligent way to play the Ethereum narrative</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Ethereum is expected to hit $2,400 and eventually $3,000 if the crypto bull market continues to pick up steam. If this happens, tokens associated with Ethereum will pump even more, much like previous bull cycles in the market.</p>
<p>With capital rotation, the rule to play by is that after Bitcoin pumps, Ethereum pumps, and then altcoins. A surge for Ethereum past $3,000 will likely give a token like $ETHETF multiples that would be difficult to find anywhere else.</p>
<p><a href="https://ethetftoken.io/">ETHETF Token</a> is an ERC-20 token that is easily accessible on Uniswap for any trader and offers bullish conditions for traders leading up to an Ethereum spot ETF approval.</p>
<p>The website indicates that there was no presale, a stealth launch and that 95% of the 100 million token supply was allocated to <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xd109c5d4a0b0557f4418574180780d52cd0793fd">DEX liquidity</a>. With liquidity now at $520,000, locked for seven days, and 24-hour volume totaling $4.37 million, conditions are perfect for explosive upside action.</p>
<p>With 5% of the token supply allocated to CEX listings, itâs an indicator that the team behind ETHETF Token intends to create something unique and not just another meme-style token. In addition to this, 2% of every buy transaction is burned, which decreases the circulating supply all the time. After just one day, 5.35% of the $ETHETF token supply has already been burned.</p>
<p>One of the projectâs major roadmap milestones happens when the first Ethereum spot ETF is approved; this will result in the 2% buy tax being removed from the smart contract, which will release the shackles for $ETHETF and encourage more upside pressure.</p>
<p>To buy the token, simply connect your crypto wallet to Uniswap, copy and paste it into the contract address to ensure you are buying the correct coin, and make your purchase. Make sure you have enough ETH left over to pay for gas.</p>

<p>Crypto lending company Celsius has transferred over $10 million worth of Ethereum to an exchange on Wednesday, just 6 days after a judge approved the firm&#8217;s bankruptcy plan.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1724347865135517951">on-chain data tracked by Lookonchain</a>, Celsius moved 5,160 ETH worth around $10.49 million to the institutional trading platform FalconX. The bankrupt company is currently transitioning to a new model under creditor ownership.</p>
<h2>Celsius Enters New Chapter Post-Bankruptcy</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/celsius-crypto-firm-files-for-bankruptcy-after-a-month-of-frozen-accounts.htm">Celsius filed for bankruptcy back in July 2022</a> amid a wider downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Under the newly approved plan, Celsius will be converted into a crypto mining and staking firm called NewCo, which is expected to have a $1.25 billion balance sheet. A portion of this balance sheet will consist of liquid crypto assets that can be staked to generate yields.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We noticed that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Celsius?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Celsius</a> transferred 5,160 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ETH</a> ($10.63M) to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FalconX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FalconX</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Celsius?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Celsius</a> also transferred a lot of tokens to exchanges and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FalconX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FalconX</a> 5 days ago.</p>
<p>It seems that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Celsius?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Celsius</a> wants to sell some assets with the rising prices.<a href="https://t.co/3gGOucC9gY">https://t.co/3gGOucC9gY</a> <a href="https://t.co/ILhpK0qLJy">pic.twitter.com/ILhpK0qLJy</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lookonchain (@lookonchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1724347865135517951?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The transfer of Ethereum suggests Celsius may be looking to sell some holdings to raise capital as part of this transition. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-bulls-hold-2000-level-where-is-eth-heading-next.htm">Ethereum prices</a> have climbed nearly 70% since the start of 2023, recovering from the lows seen last year. The timing could allow Celsius to offload ETH at relatively favorable rates.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Sale Preps Celsius for Focus on Staking</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to Lookonchain, Celsius has also recently moved various other tokens to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/review_categories/exchanges/">exchanges</a> like Binance and OKX. These include stablecoins, governance tokens like SPELL, and utility tokens like BAT. The bankrupt company seems to be liquidating parts of its portfolio across the board.</p>
<p>Last week, a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/court-approves-celsius-networks-bankruptcy-exit-transition-to-bitcoin-miner.htm">judge approved a restructuring plan</a> that will formally sign over ownership of Celsius to its creditors. Under the new ownership structure, creditors are expected to benefit from the staking yields generated by Celsius&#8217; remaining crypto assets. Estimates suggest the staking operation could bring in <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/11/10/celsius-bankruptcy-resolution-2-billion-customers-newco-staking-mining/">$10 to $20 million per year</a>.</p>
<p>The decision came after months of uncertainty surrounding the fate of the troubled lender. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-firm-celsius-pauses-all-transfers-withdrawals-between-accounts-2022-06-13/">Celsius halted withdrawals back in June 2022</a>, citing extreme market conditions. The freeze left thousands of customers unable to access their assets held on the platform.</p>
<p><iframe title="Celsius&#039;s NEW Disclosure Statement -  How Much Earn &amp; Loans Is Going To Get Back?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mxn94Nt4gKI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s bankruptcy filing followed shortly after, with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/22/celsius-might-be-planning-to-turn-its-debt-into-crypto-iou-tokens/">Celsius owing creditors nearly $5 billion</a> at the time. The restructuring plan lays out the terms for creditors to recover a portion of the owed funds.</p>
<p>With ownership now being transferred to creditors, Celsius is distancing itself from its former retail lending model. <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174911092380000000117.pdf">The approved bankruptcy plan</a> explicitly forbids the newly formed entity from &#8220;engaging in lending or rehypothecation of assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/654e46881bb3d608ca35d284/#:~:text=Celsius%20will%20be%20reformed%20into,collecting%20fees%20from%20staking%20validators.">NewCo will function</a> solely as a crypto mining and staking enterprise, using protocols like Lido to generate staking yields from assets like Ethereum. Liquidating ETH holdings to exchanges aligns with this strategy pivot.</p>
<p>The year-long Celsius drama highlights the risks associated with crypto lending platforms. Attractive yields enticed customers, but overly speculative practices put customer deposits in jeopardy when markets declined. With new management in place, Celsius hopes to chart a more sustainable path forward.</p>
