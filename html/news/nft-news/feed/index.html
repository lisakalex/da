<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cristiano Ronaldo trained with holders of his non-fungible token (NFT) in a Binance event amid several investors seeking damages from the sports star in a United States lawsuit.</p>
<p>On Jan 25, Ronaldo played football with selected NFT holders in a <a href="https://youtu.be/Ctdq2cH_Lvw?si=25jSxv2c1j6yrqFm">training drill in Lisbon</a> alongside Binance ambassador Khaby Lame and footballer Maria Markovic.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meeting and training with one of the greatest athletes of all time, <a href="https://twitter.com/Cristiano?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Cristiano</a> Ronaldo.</p>
<p>Sounds to good to be true? For holders of the rarest ForeverCR7 NFTs on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a>, we made it a reality.</p>
<p>Click below to read about their experience!<a href="https://t.co/RUxlbN5AC9">https://t.co/RUxlbN5AC9</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1750549600652386640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Golden Ticket was part of the CR7 Forever Zone Collection and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cristiano-ronaldo-launches-nft-collection-with-binance-crypto-exchange.htm">GOAT NFT Series.</a> The Golden Ticket holder and four other users selected at random got a chance to play alongside the football star.</p>
<p>The event ‚ÄúTrain with CR7‚Äù saw Ronaldo teach participants several football techniques including penalty decisions with Khaby Lame in goal.</p>
<p>Fans described the event as an unbelievable once-in-a-lifetime chance to practice their favorite sport with one of the best players.</p>
<p>Ronaldo shared highlights of the session on his Instagram page. The footballer noted that it was an amazing fan experience set up by the exchange expressing gratitude to the holders of his rarest NFTs.</p>
<h2>Ronaldo‚Äôs NFTs Journey</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In June 2022, the former Real Madrid and Manchester United player announced a multi-year NFT partnership with Binance with former CEO Changpeng Zhao praising the sports star for boasting one of the most dedicated fan bases through skill and authenticity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f91d.png" alt="ü§ù" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/Cristiano?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Cristiano</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f410.png" alt="üêê" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>We&#39;re kicking off an exclusive multi-year NFT partnership with football legend Cristiano Ronaldo. </p>
<p>This is your opportunity to own an iconic piece of sports history and join CR7&#39;s Web3 community. <a href="https://t.co/3j1lKcqrbn">pic.twitter.com/3j1lKcqrbn</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1539969367726620674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On his part, Ronaldo noted that he would like to bring new experiences to his fans as he always wanted to be a part of the NFT platform.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúMy relationship with the fans is very important to me, so the idea of bringing unprecedented experiences and access through this NFT platform is something that I wanted to be a part of.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<h2>NFT Leads to Lawsuit in the United States<i>¬†</i></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
However, one year later, Ronaldo <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/soccer-superstar-cristiano-ronaldo-sued-for-promoting-binance-crypto-exchange-heres-the-latest.htm">faces a lawsuit</a> in the United States over promoting the NFT with Binance.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs claim he participated in the offer and sale of unregistered securities in partnership with Binance claiming damages of over $1 billion.</p>
<p>In 2022, the cheapest of the digital collectibles were priced at $77 but plunged to $1 a year later with investors claiming that Ronaldo‚Äôs involvement led to a 500% increase in searches.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúRonaldo‚Äôs promotions solicited or assisted Binance in soliciting investments in unregistered securities by encouraging his millions of followers, fans, and supporters to invest with the Binance platform.‚Äù<i>¬†</i></p></blockquote>
<p>On Jan 16, plaintiffs sought to serve the sports star through substituted means like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-customers-seek-to-serve-1b-lawsuit-to-ronaldo-via-x.htm">email and social media</a> as efforts to locate his residence in Saudi Arabia have been difficult</p>

<p>Daily NFT news: Bitcoin and Solana cross swords over the 2<sup>nd</sup> place among the top 10, Ronin unveils a major wallet upgrade, and Rario is set to close the current platform and launch a new one.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Solana Duke It Out</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
We‚Äôve recently seen <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-mystery-deepens-with-21000-ordinal-inscriptions-airdropped-in-enigmatic-bitcoin-game.htm">Bitcoin</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-sales-solana-bitcoin-ethereum-weekly-trading-volume.htm">Solana</a></strong> crossing swords over the coveted second place in the top 10 blockchains per NFT sales volume.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-begins-technical-assessment-to-onboard-new-ethereum-execution-client-for-diversity.htm">Ethereum</a> </strong>has been firmly holding the first place, and it‚Äôs still there. Though its volume is slightly down, it stands at $9.4 million, <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">according</a> to <strong>CryptoSlam</strong>.</p>
<p>But the second-place occupant has been shifting between two other popular chains. Just yesterday, Solana was there, and today, Bitcoin pushed it out. The latter‚Äôs higher increase in sales percentage-wise tipped the scale.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is up over 21% in the last day, with a current volume of $7.6 million. Very close by is Solana, at $7.42 million. It‚Äôs up nearly 3% over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>And speaking of Ronin‚Ä¶.</p>
<h2>Ronin Reveals Wallet Upgrade</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/axie-infinitys-ronin-chain-hack-exposes-risks-of-proof-of-stake-centralization-analysts.htm">Ronin</a></strong>, an EVM blockchain crafted for developers building games with player-owned economies, announced a large upgrade to its official crypto wallet.</p>

<p><a href="https://roninchain.com/blog/posts/the-2024-ronin-wallet-glow-up">Per</a> the blog post, the team is releasing ‚Äúa flurry of new features‚Äù that will bring stronger security, multi-chain support (including <strong>Ethereum</strong> and other chains), an in-app browser, and more.</p>

<h2>Rario Closes Existing NFT Product, Plans a New One</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Rario</strong>, a cricket-focused NFT platform, has announced the closure of its current platform.</p>
<p>The team said it could not live up to the users‚Äô expectations due to the issues faced over the last half a year. These include the NFT sector crash, management failures, and new Web3 regulations creating industry headwinds.</p>
<p>Therefore, it has formed a new management team. But to make positive changes, they argued, they‚Äôll have to sunset the current Rario product on January 29.</p>
<p>Wallet cash balances will be available for withdrawal until March 31.</p>

<p>That said, the platform has announced ‚Äúa new and improved version of Rario.‚Äù In March, the team will launch a new platform with new cricket-based games.</p>
<p>However, the existing Rario cards will be unusable on the new <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/unstoppable-domains-and-the-sandbox-partner-to-launch-new-metaverse-experience-more-crypto-news.htm">gaming</a> platform. The owners will get additional perks, with more details coming in February, the team said.</p>
<p>This has caused issues, with the platform acknowledging that ‚Äúsome‚Äù users ‚Äúhave experienced losses‚Äù from investment in these cards.</p>
<p>The team claims to be working with stakeholders on a compensation plan. More details should be available next week.</p>

<h2>Weekly NFT Sales Drop, Solana Ahead of Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
NFT sales for the past week have dropped. Falling 13%, they currently sit at $268,396,450.</p>
<p>The number of transactions is down, too. It has dropped 19% to 2.3 million.</p>
<p>Not everything is red, though. Buyers are up 51% in seven days. Meanwhile, the number of sellers increased 57%.</p>
<p>Notably, <strong>Solana</strong> has kept its position ahead of <strong>Bitcoin</strong> in this period despite the latter‚Äôs recent rise. Solana is in the second place of the top 10 blockchains by NFT sales volume.</p>
<p><strong>Ethereum</strong>, in the first spot, has dropped over 30% but maintained its position with $9.8 million. Solana is relatively close now (even with a 6% drop) with $7.88 million.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, ranking third, fell 22% in a week to $6.19 million. The four-ranked <strong>Polygon</strong> is quite far behind with $1.6 million in volume (down 32%).</p>

<p>Buyers and sellers are both up around 2%, while transactions are down 10%.</p>
<p>Among the top 10 collections by sales volume, <strong>CryptoPunks </strong>made the NFT news rounds and took the first spot with over $3.5 million.</p>

<h2>Non-Fungible DAO Unveiled, Powered by NFT</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<strong>Non-Fungible DAO</strong> (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) introduced itself on Monday. It <a href="https://twitter.com/Non_FungibleDAO/status/1749446837973532747">said</a> that would be a community-owned, decentralized organization.</p>
<p>Its mission: to develop and drive adoption of the protocols that will power the future of NFT commerce.</p>
<p>While digital asset adoption is still in its early phases, the future will see most of the world interacting with NFTs every day, argued the team.</p>
<p>Non-Fungible DAO owns and governs open-source technologies for NFTs across major chains. This includes smart contracts originally developed by the <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/first-of-its-kind-nft-centric-wallet-by-magic-eden-set-to-transform-digital-collecting-nfts-making-a-comeback.htm">Magic Eden</a></strong> marketplace on four chains: <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-stablecoin-transfers-hit-monthly-record-of-300-billion-sol-adoption-rising.htm">Solana</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-plunges-below-40000-down-nearly-20-from-post-etf-launch-highs-heres-how-low-the-btc-bears-could-bury-the-price.htm">Bitcoin</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterins-zuzalu-retreat-spurs-ethereum-backed-zu-villages-whats-behind-this-mysterious-gathering.htm">Ethereum</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/banks-will-invest-in-blockchain-when-they-make-money-from-bitcoin-etf-more-crypto-news.htm">Polygon</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Per the DAO, each NFT token holder will be able to vote on governance and the use of the ecosystem funds.</p>
<p>Most of the NFT token supply will be allocated to the community. Community members who use the protocols owned by the Non-Fungible DAO can earn the token.</p>
<p>As for ‚ÄúWEN NFT,‚Äù the team said ‚ÄúSOON.‚Äù</p>
<p>The token is still not deployed, they said, and there are no airdrops yet. MagicEden CEO Jack Lu also commented on the news:</p>

<h2>CryptoPunks Ranks #1, Relaunches CryptoPunks721</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The popular <strong>CryptoPunks</strong> collection has taken the first spot per sales volume today. <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">According</a> to CryptoSlam, it is up 12% over the last 24 hours, currently standing at $3,550,498.</p>
<p>Its buyers are up 56%, sellers 25%, and transactions 29%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CryptoPunks team initially <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptopunksnfts/status/1738301564195164622">released</a> CryptoPunks721 in <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptopunksnfts/status/1737556934281003451">December</a>. They <a href="https://twitter.com/0xQuit/status/1748073786300334357">encountered some issues</a>, having to fix those and relaunch on Thursday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Punks, thanks for your patience. The team has identified and fixed the issue with the Stash contract, and CryptoPunks721 has been relaunched.</p>
<p>The goal of CryptoPunks721 is to create a safer and healthier eco-system for the Punk community &#8211; with a more efficient, officially‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/no5vUn7tLv">pic.twitter.com/no5vUn7tLv</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><a href="https://721.cryptopunks.app/">Per</a> the website, CryptoPunks721 is the official CryptoPunks smart contract for converting CryptoPunk tokens into ERC-721 tokens by ‚Äúwrapping‚Äù them.</p>
<p>ERC-721 is a data standard on <strong>Ethereum</strong> on which most NFT collections are built. However, CryptoPunks predates the creation of the ERC-721 standard. Therefore, to work smoothly with certain protocols, it must be converted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe conversion process is called ‚Äúwrapping‚Äù and creates a CryptoPunks721 wrapped CryptoPunk,‚Äù the team said.</p>
<p>Wrapping enables owners to use their NFTs on platforms or in ecosystems that primarily support fungible tokens. This includes NFT marketplaces and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.</p>
<p>CryptoPunks can also be unwraped at any time.</p>
<p>The wrapper contract is gas-optimized, said the team, using about half of the gas as the third-party contract for wrapping, unwrapping, and transferring CryptoPunks.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Records Highest Volume Since June</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On Thursday, January 18, the trading volume of the <strong>Ethereum</strong> NFT market hit $42.7 million. This was the first time this number exceeded $40 million since the end of June last year.</p>
<p>The news was first <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1748541866457584038">published</a> by journalist Colin Wu.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the second-highest <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/NFTs">daily volume</a> was $32.52 million, seen on January 12.</p>
<p>Since Thursday, however, the trading volume has gone back down, though to somewhat higher levels than the weeks prior and on par with those recorded in early December last year.</p>
<p>Friday recorded $29.6 million, Saturday $28.2 million, and Sunday $25.6 million.</p>

<p>The weekly volume, too, has shot up to the heights first seen since June 2023.</p>
<p>As recorded on January 15, the weekly volume was up to just below $204 million. A week earlier, it stood at $168.9 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the end of June last year saw $216.6 million in weekly trading volume.</p>

<h2>NFTs Are Attracting Corporate America</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Following the drop in NFT markets compared to two years ago, profits are far away, but Corporate America is still finding useful ways to utilize NFTs, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2024/01/19/forget-boredapes-and-cryptopunks-nfts-are-making-a-comeback-in-corporate-branding/">according</a> to Forbes.</p>
<p>Per the report,</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúNow that the market has crashed, a much less ambitious version of NFTs are finding a welcome home in the marketing departments of corporate America.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Making the rounds in NFT news, companies like <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-news-summary-mastercard-launches-start-path-crypto-meta-bringing-nft-minting-trading-to-instagram.htm">MasterCard</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coca-cola-and-top-daos-join-coinbases-onchain-summer-web3-festival-for-base-launch.htm">Coca-Cola</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/starbucks-celebrates-20-years-of-pumpkin-spice-latte-with-nft-collectibles.htm">Starbucks</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/immutable-eliminates-fees-in-zkevm-gaming-solution-more-news.htm">Lufthansa</a></strong> have all found ways to employ these tokens. And sneaker companies ‚Äúmay represent the perfect marriage of NFT technology and brand marketing,‚Äù Forbes wrote.</p>
<p>The companies that decided to launch their own collections include <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nike-rtfkt-nft-collections-generate-1-4-billion-in-trading-volume.htm">Nike</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/investor-purchases-330-adidas-nfts-using-smart-contract-328-more-than-cap.htm">Adidas</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jay-zs-roc-nation-and-puma-collaborate-on-nft-enhanced-sneakers.htm">Puma</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Nike‚Äôs Dunk Genesis collection ‚Äúwas a huge success,‚Äù according to Steven Vasilev, co-founder of NFT studio <strong>RTFKT</strong>, purchased by Nike in December 2021. ‚ÄúEven though the market is still down, our products are still bringing in new people. [‚Ä¶] Where Nike serves athletes, we serve creators.‚Äù</p>
<p>Many of these collections are used through a loyalty program, so trading is discouraged. Hence, these won‚Äôt contribute to volume on NFT marketplaces.</p>
<p>However, Paul Brody, global blockchain lead at consulting firm <strong>Ernst &amp; Young</strong>, argued that,</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-nft-news-today-18-january.htm">NFT</a>) is seeing another mixed day with NFT news varying in sentiment.</p>
<p>Sales volume was down 13% over the past 24 hours at the time of writing and is currently at $42,893,676.</p>
<p>NFT transactions have seen a 9% drop in the same period. And while sellers are down 3.5%, buyers are up nearly 10%.</p>
<p>MintID is the best performer among the top 10 collections by sales volume. It went up 382% in a day to $2.2 million. The second-best <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/mutant-ape-planet-nft-designer-pleads-guilty-to-fraud-faces-5-years-in-prison.htm">Mutant Ape Yacht Club</a></strong> increased 74% to $949,433.</p>
<p><strong>CryptoUndeads</strong>, though taking the first place among the top 10, has also seen the largest drop in volume: 72% to $2.3 million. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pudgy-penguins-unveils-web3-game-pudgy-world-powered-by-zksync-era.htm"><strong>Pudgy Penguins</strong></a> follow it¬†with a 49% drop to $2 million.</p>
<p>Decreased sales volume certainly hasn‚Äôt slowed down the NFT news mill.</p>
<p>Today in NFT news, read about Coinbase NFTs‚Äô new AI-powered feature, the Nifty Island‚Äôs open beta, and Nyan Heroes‚Äô early access play-to-airdrop and its first airdrop quiz.</p>
<h2>Coinbase‚Äôs Marketplace Unveils AI-generated NFT Feature</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Creating NFTs can be quite complicated ‚Äì and potentially pricy ‚Äì for the average user.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arguments-conclude-in-coinbase-and-sec-case-judge-failla-holds-on-decision.htm">Coinbase‚Äôs</a> </strong>NFT marketplace has revealed <strong>Instamint</strong>. This novel feature is powered by artificial intelligence (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/ai-crypto-coins/">AI</a>) to enable all users to generate their own NFTs.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>The new tool is meant to simplify the NFT creation process, possibly helping aspiring artists.</p>
<p>To generate ‚Äúan on-chain collection, for you, or for sale,‚Äù as the website <a href="https://nft.coinbase.com/mint/base">says</a>, a user just needs to add a photo and name, describe the future NFT, and set the gas price in ETH.</p>
<p>The last one is optional, starting with $0.01.</p>
<p>Coinbase NFT <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-nft-marketplace-launches-in-beta-plans-to-move-beyond-ethereum.htm">launched in beta</a> in June 2023.</p>
<p>The platform has been built as an open marketplace where users can trade NFTs utilizing their own non-custodial wallets, such as <strong>MetaMask</strong>, without having to use the Coinbase Wallet, the team said.</p>
<p>The exchange also noted that it planned to decentralize the marketplace by ‚Äúmoving [features] from Coinbase tech to decentralized solutions.‚Äù It would also add support for NFTs on blockchains other than <strong>Ethereum</strong>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has launched yet another series of digital collectibles, sparking controversy in the cryptocurrency community.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s latest creation is hosted on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> blockchain but has a unique twist.</p>
<h2>Trump Digital Trading Cards on Bitcoin Ordinals Come with Limitations</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
What sets these digital collectibles apart is that they cannot be traded on their owners until December 2024. This limitation has left many enthusiasts scratching their heads.</p>
<p>In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/CollectTrump/status/1748054959843622941" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent post on X</span></a>, the official Trump Cards account said collectors who are willing to invest $99 for 100 of the &#8220;mugshot edition&#8221; NFTs, which were issued on the Polygon blockchain in December, will also receive a unique digital card, known as an &#8220;ordinal,&#8221; on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s announcement on social media touted these as &#8220;The First Ever Trump Trading Cards officially created on the Bitcoin Blockchain!&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TRUMP DIGITAL TRADING CARDS on BITCOIN ORDINALS <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f7e7.png" alt="üüß" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The FIRST EVER Trump Trading Cards on Bitcoin. Read this thread <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b07.png" alt="‚¨á" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&mdash; CollectTrumpCards (@CollectTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/CollectTrump/status/1748054959843622941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, the announcement thread featured grammatical errors and non-standard capitalization, drawing further attention to the venture.</p>
<p>The catch is that only 200 of these &#8220;one of one&#8221; Ordinals will be minted.</p>
<p>This limitation, supposedly aimed at preventing them from being seen as &#8220;investment vehicles,&#8221; has paradoxically diminished their appeal as NFTs in the eyes of potential buyers.</p>
<h2>Donald Trump&#8217;s Foray in NFTs and Digital Collectibles</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/billionaire-and-ex-us-president-donald-trump-launches-official-nft-project-this-is-what-you-need-to-know.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a>, the former president released the NFT collection, dubbed ‚ÄúTrump Cards,‚Äù in December 2022.</p>
<p>The NFT collection features a series of digital ‚Äúcards‚Äù depicting Trump in various iconic poses and situations, which include Trump as a muscle-bound wrestling champion, Trump holding a basketball, and even Trump in space.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to data from OpenSea, the series of NFTs has generated over $26 million in trading volume.</p>
<p>Trump launched his second series of Trump Trading Cards in August last year, which also sold out immediately after release.</p>
<p>The second collection featured 47,000 tokens, each with a price tag of $99, this time with limited one-of-one NFTs and autographed cards.<br />
Speculation surrounding the ownership of the NFT projects has been rampant since its initial release.</p>
<p>On the official Trump Trading Cards website, it says that CIC Digital LLC allowed NFT INT LLC, the company behind the NFT project, to use <a href="https://collecttrumpcards.com/">Trump‚Äôs likeness, name, and image</a> under a paid licensing agreement.</p>
<p>The project‚Äôs website also claims that funds raised from the NFTs won‚Äôt be used for Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign.</p>
<p>In an April filing, Trump <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-filing-reveals-trump-earned-up-1-million-from-nft-sales-heres-what-you-need-know.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed that he has raked in up to $1 million</span></a> from the sales of his digital trading cards.</p>
<p>The filing was part of his personal financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission, which also showed that the American politician earned millions from speaking engagements.</p>
<p>According to the filing, Trump holds the position of ‚Äúmanager, president, secretary and treasurer‚Äù at CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Starting January 16, Starbucks will gift NFT to Rewards customers who order beverages via <strong>Siren Order</strong> (mobile order) using their personal cups.</p>
<p>Notably, each purchase will earn one Eco Stamp, with a maximum of three stamps a day.</p>
<p>There are three tiers of collectible NFTs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>BASIC: customers can redeem one NFT for five Eco Stamps.</li>
<li>CREATIVE: collecting fifteen Eco Stamps will unlock this limited edition with a total of 20,000 NFTs available;</li>
<li>ARTIST: twenty Eco Stamps will grant the collector access to the limited edition of 1,000 NFTs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Furthermore, the NFTs are designed in collaboration with Korea&#8217;s major digital art platform &#8216;Print Bakery.&#8217; They feature the works of artist DADAZ and many local artists.</p>
<p>They showcase diverse digital artwork based on the concept of &lsquo;My Own Cup,&rsquo; featuring reusable cups and tumblers, the press release said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The functionality of the Starbucks NFTs will be limited, with restrictions on gifting, selling, or trading,&rdquo; it added.
</p>
<h2>The Nyan Heroes Coming to Epic Games Store</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
The <strong>Nyan Heroes</strong> team has made the NFT news list today by <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/nyan-heroes-dev-aacbbd" rel="sponsored">announcing</a> that it will release its upcoming PC battle royale shooter on the major digital distribution platform <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-brawlers-enters-fortnites-home-launches-on-epic-games-store-to-230-million-gamers-globally.htm">Epic Games Store</a></strong>, the developer of the massively popular&nbsp;<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fortnite" rel="sponsored"><strong>Fortnite</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/nyan-heroes-dev-faq-2a6189" rel="sponsored">According</a> to the FAQ, Nyan Heroes is a free-to-play, third-person hero shooter where intelligent cats pilot powerful mechs known as Guardians.</p>
<p>The game enables players to use NFTs, but it&rsquo;s optional. The team said that,
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Primarily, NFTs will be used as an ownership layer for certain digital assets earnt or bought in the game.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Nyan Heroes will eventually have a marketplace that will allow users to trade in-game items with each other for use in and out of gameplay sessions, it added.</p>
<p>The game uses the <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-overtakes-xrp-is-10000-sol-possible.htm">Solana</a></strong> blockchain. It doesn&rsquo;t require an external wallet, but it supports a collection via <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/phantom-wallet-guide-how-to-set-up-get-started.htm">Phantom Wallet</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The official release date is yet to be announced. A &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo; page is ready, stating this is an Early Access game. It means it is still under development and may change over time. It is free to play.
</p>
<h2>Pudgy Penguins NFT News: Today&rsquo;s Best Performers</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Popular NFT collection <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/adorable-penguins-are-taking-over-the-nft-scene-11427.htm">Pudgy Penguins</a></strong> is the best performer today among the top 5 collections by sales volume.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/" rel="sponsored">According</a> to <strong>CryptoSlam</strong>, its sales volume is up 153% over the past 24 hours. It has climbed to the fourth place.</p>
<figure id="attachment_151920" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151920" style="width: 898px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-151920" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705405081-cryptoslam-io.png" alt="" width="898" height="308" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705405081-cryptoslam-io.png 898w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705405081-cryptoslam-io-300x103.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705405081-cryptoslam-io-768x263.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705405081-cryptoslam-io-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-151920" class="wp-caption-text">Source: cryptoslam.io</figcaption></figure>
<p>Transactions are up 114%, buyers 38%, and sellers 67%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big time for the project. In December, Pudgy Penguins <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/pudgy-penguins-unveils-web3-game-pudgy-world-powered-by-zksync-era.htm">announced the upcoming alpha launch</a> of <strong>Pudgy World</strong>, a Web3 game based on the <strong>Ethereum</strong> Layer 2 network <strong>zkSync Era</strong>.</p>
<p>The team described the new game as &ldquo;an immersive, digital environment&rdquo; available to Pudgy Penguins NFT holders, Pudgy Toy owners, and all &ldquo;adventurous gamers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They expect to launch the alpha soon, in Q1 of this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the team announced on Tuesday that it partnered with <strong><a href="https://www.oldmasterq.com/" rel="sponsored">Old Master Q (&#32769;&#22827;&#23376;)</a> </strong>for their 60th Anniversary.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A cryptic message has recently surfaced on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> blockchain, leaving the crypto community buzzing with curiosity.</p>
<p>The message, discovered <a href="https://www.ord.io/55365041" rel="sponsored">within Ordinals inscription 55,365,041</a>, has ignited the imaginations of Bitcoin enthusiasts. Many are eager to decipher its enigmatic meaning and speculate about the possibility of a new and intriguing Ordinals art project. The message reads:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;10,000 sats, side by side. A single UTXO, untouched inside. Born together, cursed at heart. Built with code, Bitcoin Art.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Accompanying this cryptic text is a sequence of numbers, 391481082118 &ndash; 391481092117.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: A mysterious message was just inscribed on an Uncommon Sat which appears to have on-chain ties to an unrevealed 10K collection inscribed 1 hour before the Jubilee</p>
<p>Message ‚Üí <a href="https://t.co/LvKQuQsrrG">https://t.co/LvKQuQsrrG</a><br />Parent ‚Üí <a href="https://t.co/Sf7vqH5jhf">https://t.co/Sf7vqH5jhf</a><br />Children ‚Üí <a href="https://t.co/BYC78QH0iH">https://t.co/BYC78QH0iH</a> <a href="https://t.co/SBRYZtiFhW">pic.twitter.com/SBRYZtiFhW</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Ord.io (@ord_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/ord_io/status/1746797464877744202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</p>
<h2>What Does the Message Mean?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
To understand the cryptic message fully, we need to delve into the intricacies of the cryptocurrency world.</p>
<p>In the realm of cryptocurrency, &#8220;UTXO&#8221; stands for Unspent Transaction Output, referring to the remaining amount of a particular cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, after a transaction has occurred.</p>
<p>These unspent funds can subsequently be used in new transactions, providing a foundation for the broader blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>The mysterious message has left the Ordinals community puzzled, with many speculating that it could hint at a potential Ordinals art project or NFT profile picture (PFP) collection.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that numerous NFT projects feature 10,000 unique images or assets, making this interpretation a plausible theory.</p>
<p>However, until more details emerge, Bitcoin enthusiasts can only engage in speculative sleuthing while searching for clues before any official revelation occurs.
</p>
<h2>Not Much Details in the Ordinals Inscription</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Leonidas, a pseudonymous NFT historian and Ordinals collector claimed they &#8220;didn&#8217;t really leave us much info about what the collection actually is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The repeating nature of the inscription, akin to the famous &#8220;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&#8221; message from the classic film &#8220;The Shining,&#8221; further intensifies the mystery.</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;Born together, cursed at heart&#8221; could allude to the inscription&#8217;s association with a &#8220;cursed&#8221; parent Ordinal.</p>
<p>A quick search on Ordiscan reveals a connection to another inscription, -471,460, which features an image of a tower or obelisk.</p>
<p>While the term &#8220;Cursed Ordinals&#8221; might evoke notions of a horror movie, it actually refers to Ordinals that were initially overlooked by the Ord indexer, resulting in their absence from wallets and marketplaces.</p>
<p>These cursed inscriptions, like the tower image, were assigned negative numbers until the issue was resolved.</p>
<p>&#8220;The original version of the Ordinals indexer did not catch them; the newer versions do,&#8221; Leonidas explained, clarifying that giving these inscriptions negative numbers was the solution.
</p>
<h2>Other Inscriptions Tied in the Mystery</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Interestingly, the so-called &#8220;cursed ordinal&#8221; had ties to another parent inscription, 53,383,387, which featured a white door under a black arch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just had the Jubilee upgrade a week ago that &#8216;blessed&#8217; the edge cases that cause cursed inscriptions. So now all new inscriptions created in weird ways get a normal positive number and are not cursed.&#8221;</p>
<p>This update, however, leaves the previously cursed inscriptions forever marked with negative numbers, effectively locking a supply of approximately 470,000 cursed inscriptions.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the Ordinals protocol in January of the previous year, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-token-tap-1-billion-market-cap-as-btc-moves-past-43500.htm">over 55 million items have been minted</a> on the Bitcoin blockchain, as reported by a Dune data dashboard.</p>
<p>These items encompass a wide range of content, from a clone of the classic first-person shooter Doom to a Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) emulator.</p>
<p>Additionally, artists and collectors have utilized Ordinals to inscribe artwork and PFP collections on the blockchain while establishing a standard for deploying fungible tokens on Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Non-fungible token (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/game-over-for-nfts-will-the-market-recover-in-2024-2.htm">NFT</a>) global sales have seen a lot of green over the past month. The day&rsquo;s picture has turned red, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/" rel="sponsored">Per</a> <strong>CryptoSlam</strong>, at the time of writing, sales volume is up 8% over 30 days, while the number of buyers and sellers went up 46% and 40%, respectively.</p>
<p>In 24 hours, however, sales are down 23%. Both buyers and sellers dropped 9%.</p>
<p>This is not surprising. Crypto and NFT markets are known to be volatile. Their performance is better measured in the long term.</p>
<p>That said, the NFT news are on the rise. Today, we have CEO Devin Finzer discussing OpenSea 2.0, Nike announcing a new line of in-game wearables, and Universal Page dropping free 3D digital collectibles.</p>
<p>Read more below.
</p>
<h2>OpenSea NFT News: The Marketplace is Working on &lsquo;OpenSea 2.0&rsquo; Upgrade</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Devin Finzer, chief executive officer of NFT marketplace <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-marketplace-opensea-to-reduce-workforce-as-it-is-planning-big-changes.htm">OpenSea</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-14/once-dominant-nft-marketplace-opensea-is-touting-differentiation-after-pull-back" rel="sponsored">told</a> Bloomberg that the company is working on a platform upgrade &ndash; OpenSea 2.0.</p>
<p>Although more cases are developing, NFT platforms display all tokens in the same category.</p>
<p>Per Finzer,
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We really want to have a marketplace interface that can be better customized to suit each type of use case.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
He added that OpenSea is working on displaying ticket NFTs on a calendar and sorting them by date. The upgrade will make it easier for users to access its pro trading platform and toggle between &ldquo;a collector view and a more advanced view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, OpenSea has improved its detection of fake NFT collections and harmful URLs, he said.</p>
<p>Bloomberg noted that NFT global sales dropped 63% to $8.7 billion last year. But Finzer argued that &ldquo;trading volumes can be a little bit misleading at times.&rdquo; Some marketplaces use native tokens as rewards to incentivize activity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the things we&rsquo;ve been most excited about is not necessarily how do you drive the most volume, but rather, how do you build sort of the most compelling use cases for NFTs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We tend to not focus too much on kind of the short-term, marketplace dynamics.&rdquo;

<h2>As NFTs Rise, Nike Pushes Deeper Into Web3</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
In the latest big brands NFT News, Nike&#8217;s virtual lab <strong>.Swoosh</strong> has <a href="https://blog.swoosh.nike/an-update-on-the-future-of-swoosh-ef582788987c" rel="sponsored">announced</a> a new line called &ldquo;Nike In-Game Wearables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This year, Nike plans to launch more variations of virtual products, the blog post said. They start with In-Game Wearables, which will allow owners to wear them directly in their favorite video <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoins-flash-crash-sends-shockwaves-through-gaming-token-market.htm">games</a>.</p>
<p>Players can also unlock exclusive physical apparel and footwear in the real world based on the in-game wearables they bought.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it said,
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the second half of this year, we&rsquo;ll be allowing you to off-ramp your collectibles to your own wallet. That way, you&rsquo;ll be able to trade them with others on marketplaces that guarantee royalties to creators.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
.Swoosh emphasized that they would not be building their own platform.</p>
<p>Users won&rsquo;t need a wallet to store any new products, just link the game accounts to Nike, it said.
</p>
<h2>Universal Page Drops Free 3D Digital Collectible</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><strong>Universal Page </strong></p>
<p>has recently launched its NFT platform. Today, it&rsquo;s dropping a free 3D character, &#8220;UP Astro 725&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry for the typo. It‚Äôs dropping Monday January 15. So today.</p>
<p>&mdash; universal.page (@_universalpage) <a href="https://twitter.com/_universalpage/status/1746796785203347788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the comments, the team said that the maximum mint per wallet is one.</p>
<p><a href="https://universal.page/drops/up-astro-725" rel="sponsored">Per</a> the page, there will be 725 free items available.
</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It has no utility or roadmap, but it&#8217;s a fun character to collect and showcase that you were present when Universal Page went live.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Universal Page&rsquo;s platform, co-founded by Jake Prins and Vlad Lykhonis, former employees of <strong>Meta</strong> and <strong>Amazon</strong>, is the first NFT platform on <strong>LUKSO</strong>, an L1 blockchain created by <strong>Ethereum</strong> pioneer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-pioneer-unveils-new-blockchain-for-creatives-artists-how-does-it-work.htm">Fabian Vogelsteller</a>.</p>
<p>A week after the launch, the team <a href="https://twitter.com/_universalpage/status/1746510086866972679" rel="sponsored">said</a> &ldquo;the response has been amazing.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ve seen &ldquo;some beautiful pages being created [and] free mints getting sold out in a matter of seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They noted certain challenges as well. The systems have been constantly under attack, for example.</p>
<p>They also removed the free first mint option for the Universal Page Name, as people keep trying to abuse it.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, have faded into the background with all the chatter and excitement around a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund being approved in the US market.</p>
<p>Earlier today GameStop <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gamestop-retreats-from-crypto-space-shuts-down-nft-marketplace-amid-regulatory-hurdles.htm">revealed it has shut down</a> its NFT marketplace, signaling its withdrawal from the cryptocurrency space. The announcement was made via a statement on the platform and cites &ldquo;the continuing regulatory uncertainty of the crypto space&rdquo; as the primary reason behind this decision.</p>
<p>Another notable move was made by X, formerly known as Twitter, which quietly removed all references and options for owning NFTs as an account avatar. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/x-removes-support-for-nft-profile-pictures/" rel="sponsored">TechCrunch reported</a> on January 8, that X had silently removed a feature for paid subscribers. They&rsquo;re no longer able to set an NFT as a profile picture.
</p>
<h4><strong>NFT Trading in Decline&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>
Trading of NFTs has been in decline for over a year. Data compiled by Statista, shows the number of active wallets involved in NFT trading has declined by more than 25% between Q2 2023 and Q3 2023. This is a notable decline from the end of 2021 &mdash; when the number of users was estimated at nearly two million.</p>
<p>The NFT bear market continues which can be linked to the crypto market which has been stagnant. Is it game ove for NFTs? Or will the digital collectible make a come back?</p>
<p><b>What Causes NFTs to Surge?</b></p>
<p>NFT trading has at times surged at various moments. Statista highlights that back in 2017, the surge was connected to the popularity of collectible CryptoKitties whereas the second surge was in March 2021, had to do with media reporting the largest NFT sales to date. In August 2021 was likely caused by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1264288/axie-infinity-nft-development/" rel="sponsored">sales of Axie Infinity</a>, a popular NFT game in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>In December, <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/dapp-activity-soars-to-3-4-million-nfts-close-on-1-billion#Chapter-4" rel="sponsored">Dapp Radar reports</a> there has been a slight surge in NFT trading volume passed $994 million, an increase of 125% from the previous month, with a total of 3.67 million sales. Blur led the NFT sector with 35% market share in trading volume, followed by OKX with 32%. OpenSea dropped to a yearly low at 14%, but retains 191,000 active traders.</p>
<p>Over the years, luxury brands such as&nbsp; <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/crypto/luxury-brands-gucci-tiffany-co-dive-into-nfts-despite-slump" rel="sponsored">Prada, Gucci, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana have been launching NFTs</a>&ndash; fast forward to today and there&rsquo;s the occasional drop. One of the reasons luxury brands launched NFTs is to increase brand exposure, and combatting counterfeiting. The question arises is there a good use case case for NFTs?</p>
<p>In the art world NFTs have been used to tokenize physical assets, such as art work, and collectibles, this trend is slowly growing and reshaping th the art world and how we own, and trade digital assets.</p>

<p><strong>CryptoPunks</strong>, meanwhile, has launched a new hub as the &ldquo;living source&rdquo; for the project.</p>
<p>At the same time, major NFT projects under the Yuga Labs umbrella are the best and among the best performers today per sales volume.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check all this out in more detail.
</p>
<h2>Yuga Labs NFT News: &lsquo;Apes Come Home Remastered&rsquo;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
On January 9, the creators of the popular NFT collection <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-nft-news-today-11-january-2024.htm">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a></strong> (BAYC), <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/magic-eden-and-yuga-labs-unveil-ethereum-nft-marketplace-to-protect-creator-royalties.htm">Yuga Labs</a></strong>, <a href="https://twitter.com/OthersideMeta/status/1744796579096383679" rel="sponsored">released</a> a trailer for the third playtest of their much-anticipated metaverse project <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/should-yuga-labs-have-charged-more-for-its-otherside-nfts-ep349.htm">Otherside</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The 20-second trailer has been met with mixed reactions, to say the least. Most, however, expressed their disappointment over the video&#8217;s quality.</p>
<p>Some jokingly made suggestions:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the future probably don‚Äôt put the lag in the teaser video. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="üòÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&mdash; Spencer (@sgsand1) <a href="https://twitter.com/sgsand1/status/1744829841617064159?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Then, on January 11, the team re-released the trailer, calling it a remastered version. It jokingly said that it was celebrating the second-day anniversary.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">On January 8th, 2024 we released &quot;Apes Come Home.&quot;</p>
<p>To celebrate its 2-Day Anniversary, we&#39;re proud to announce: Apes Come Home&#8230; Remastered. <a href="https://t.co/1D5O3POcNs">pic.twitter.com/1D5O3POcNs</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It included an additional comment from the team:</p>
<p>&ldquo;APES_COME_HOME_REMASTER_60FPS_GORDON_SAYS_WE_FUCKED_UP_OUR_BAD_FINAL_FINAL&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reactions have again been mixed but seem much more favorable. Besides the clear improvements to the video, many appreciated the team&rsquo;s comment as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some argue that increasing resolution has improved the video but hasn&rsquo;t made it as good as it could&rsquo;ve been.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ok I know this is in game trailer and all but if you really want to pump us up we need a trailer like you used to do with our apes:</p>
<p>This was beautiful, elegant, and pulled heartstrings with a call back<br />To the doors music from the first trailer. <a href="https://t.co/fL8CsduSgo">https://t.co/fL8CsduSgo</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a year ago, Yuga Labs/ BAYC co-founder Wylie Aronow (Gordon Goner) announced his departure from the project as a core team member to focus on his health.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wasn‚Äôt meant as a criticism of the otherside team. Just wanted to clarify because the island is sick. Walking around with blue beams on BAYC Island is literally a dream come true. Major kudos to the team for getting us this far.

<h2>CryptoPunks Brand Hub Unveiled</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
One of the most popular NFT projects unveiled its brand hub. The <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/creator-of-record-breaking-nft-beeple-purchases-first-pfp-nft-cryptopunk-4593.htm">CryptoPunks</a></strong> team described it as &ldquo;an archive and living source for project info and initiatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://hub.cryptopunks.app/" rel="sponsored">Per</a> the website,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Part iconic NFT collection, part living art and technology experiment. What began as 10,000 pixel punks born on the blockchain in 2017 is now an evolving collaboration with a community of creatives, builders, and technologists. With an archival program that preserves the collection&rsquo;s significance in digital art history and pioneering initiatives and unique partnerships that build on its legacy, the punk spirit remains at the heart of CryptoPunks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was created with the US-based strategy, design, and technology agency <strong>Alright Studio</strong>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;new work in collaboration with our friends cryptopunksnfts &mdash; a living, breathing, and ever-evolving archival hub,&rdquo; the agency <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptopunksnfts/status/1745480717428297729" rel="sponsored">commented</a>. &ldquo;more soon!&rdquo;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The hub currently has the &lsquo;about&rsquo;, &lsquo;legacy&rsquo;, &lsquo;index&rsquo;, and &lsquo;marketplace&rsquo; pages already up. The &lsquo;cart&rsquo; and &lsquo;goods&rsquo; sections are coming soon, it says.</p>
<p><strong>Larva Labs</strong> created CryptoPunks in 2017. In 2022, Yuga Labs announced that it acquired the intellectual property rights to Larva Labs&#8217; CryptoPunks and <strong>Meebits</strong> collections.
</p>
<h2>BAYC Sales Jump 570% in a Day, CryptoPunks Up 510%</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Still in the Yuga Labs realm, its <strong>BAYC</strong> and <strong>CryptoPunks</strong> are the day&rsquo;s best performers among the top 10 collections when it comes to sales volume.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/" rel="sponsored">According</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>CryptoSlam</strong>, BAYC sales are up by 568.5% over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s followed by CryptoPunks&#8217; 510%.</p>

<p>Both of these collections have moved up since yesterday.</p>
<p>BAYC is up one position in a day, moving to the second spot on the list.</p>
<p>CryptoPunks wasn&rsquo;t even in the top 5 yesterday but now sits as number three.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yuga Labs&#8217; <strong>Mutant Ape Yacht Club</strong> (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/luxury-brand-gucci-collaborates-with-bored-ape-creator-yuga-labs-for-metaverse-project-crypto-adoption-rise.htm">MAYC</a>) has also performed well. Its sales are up 80%.</p>
<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s been a good day for Yuga Labs.</p>

<p>But there is far more happening in the space than just numbers.</p>
<p>Check out the most important NFT-related news discussed today in crypto circles and beyond.</p>
<h2>Elon Musk Removes NFT PFPs from Twitter, Making This the Top NFT News Today</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Unsurprisingly, this has been the biggest news today.</p>
<p>The Social media giant, now called <strong>X</strong>, has removed support for NFTs from its premium subscription page.</p>
<p>On January 9, the option was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240109110210/https:/help.twitter.com/en/using-x/x-premium">still available</a>. The &#8216;Create a Community&#8217; section still stated that: ‚ÄúAs a Premium subscriber, you can create and customize your profile so you can show off the NFTs you own in a hex-shaped profile picture on your account.‚Äù</p>
<p>It continued: ‚ÄúAfter a temporary connection to your crypto wallet that allows you to set up an NFT as your profile picture, your digital asset displays in a special hexagon shape that identifies you as the owner of that NFT.‚Äù</p>
<p>Its FAQ page also contained a number of NFT-related questions, answers, and explanations.</p>
<p>As of January 10, the &#8216;Create a Community&#8217; section simply states: ‚ÄúAs a Premium subscriber, you can create a community on X to connect with people who share similar interests.‚Äù Rather vague and obvious.</p>
<p>There are currently <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-x/x-premium">no mentions</a> of NFTs anywhere on the premium support page.</p>
<p>Many argued that this was a relevant tool that helped strengthen security in the space.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">why did elon remove the hexagon nft pfp from x?</p>
<p>this was an important feature for subscribed users to help identify owners of the nft apart from scammers</p>
<p>i do not support this decision</p>
<p>&mdash; drone (@dronerogan) <a href="https://twitter.com/dronerogan/status/1745138842321994229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Some, however, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/193dvcn/comment/kh8sbey/">opined</a> that Twitter may be gearing up to offer its own, exclusive NFTs. This possibility encountered mostly criticism, as it would be yet another centralized entity trying to profit from its users via potentially useless tokens.</p>
<h2>Are NFT ETFs Next?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) has <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-frenzy-begins-as-sec-finally-approves-first-spot-bitcoin-funds-bitcoin-remains-unresponsive.htm">finally approved</a> the first spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-to-custody-eight-spot-bitcoin-etfs-following-sec-approval.htm">Bitcoin</a> exchange-traded funds (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/robinhood-set-to-list-spot-bitcoin-etfs-as-soon-as-possible.htm">ETFs</a>) in the US.</p>
<p>But NFT platform <strong>Epik Prime</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/EpikPrime/status/1745385164791013639">asked</a>: ‚ÄúNext up, NFT ETFs?‚Äù</p>
<p>The platform argued that, ‚ÄúCompared to traditional ETFs that often cater to stocks or commodities, we envision that an NFT ETF would allow investors to have a diversified portfolio of NFTs such as collectibles, digital art, and virtual real estate, enabling you to invest in these assets in a simple to access security.‚Äù</p>
<p>Some funds could also be developed to become select NFT baskets to mitigate individual NFTs‚Äô volatility.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We got the green light! SEC approved 11 Spot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinETF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BitcoinETF</a> </p>
<p>Next up, NFT ETFs?</p>
<p>Compared to traditional ETFs that often cater to stocks or commodities, we envision that an NFT ETF would allow investors to have a diversified portfolio of NFTs such as collectibles, digital art, and‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/aoDYpLXX5F">pic.twitter.com/aoDYpLXX5F</a></p>
<p>&mdash; EPIK Prime (@EpikPrime) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpikPrime/status/1745385164791013639?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As the market grows, the possibility of an NFT ETF looks promising, Epik Prime argued.</p>
<p>With more capital coming into the sector, it could open many doors. This includes increased liquidity, lower fees, and specialized ETFs focusing on specific sectors like art, gaming, music, and IP-backed NFTs. Will the NFT news section feature an ETF announcement soon as well?</p>
<h2>OpenSea Simplifies Wallet Creation: Only Email Needed</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Dealing with NFTs can be daunting. Just setting up everything necessary to start an NFT journey can be complex. This is a well-known obstacle to the mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>Major NFT marketplace <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-marketplace-opensea-to-reduce-workforce-as-it-is-planning-big-changes.htm">OpenSea</a></strong> <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/articles/opensea-new-onboarding-experience">stated</a> that it launched ‚Äúa new way to get started‚Äù on the platform. Users can create a wallet with just an email address.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a self-custodied wallet, so users keep control over their NFTs.</p>
<p>They can then buy, sell, and transfer the tokens with support for credit and debit card purchases.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">NFTs just got a whole lot easier. </p>
<p>Introducing the new OpenSea onboarding experience, where you can sign up and create a self-custodied wallet with just an email address. <a href="https://t.co/C4xjjKYg4k">pic.twitter.com/C4xjjKYg4k</a></p>
<p>&mdash; OpenSea (@opensea) <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1744793012234834074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Users can also manage funds and view transactions on the blockchain without a separate wallet extension.</p>
<p>It can be used across all nine EVM-based chains compatible with OpenSea.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">X (formerly Twitter), under the ownership of Elon Musk, has discontinued a feature that allowed premium users to use non-fungible token (NFT) images as their profile pictures.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The feature,¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/twitter-introduces-verified-nft-profile-pics-sets-up-foundation-account.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">introduced in January two years ago</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, was aimed at Twitter Blue subscribers, offering them the ability to display a verifiable NFT as their profile picture.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The initiative was seen as a pioneering step in the social media sphere, validating the use of NFTs at a time when other major platforms like Facebook and Instagram, owned by <a href="https://about.meta.com/">Meta</a>, were yet to integrate such technology.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, recent developments indicate that the option to activate this feature via the iPhone version of the Twitter app is no longer available.¬†</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The absence of this option in the app&#8217;s current iteration suggests a strategic pivot by Elon Musk, although X has not yet made any official statements regarding this decision.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What Was Twitter&#8217;s NFT Profile Picture Feature</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The NFT profile picture feature allowed users to use Ethereum blockchain technology to verify the ownership of their NFT, which then appeared as a hexagonal image, differentiating it from the standard circular profile pictures.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The future of this verification method and the hexagonal profile picture format is currently unclear, especially for users who still have an NFT-equipped profile picture.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The move comes amidst a backdrop of evolving attitudes towards NFTs and blockchain technology in the social media industry.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Meta, for example, recently announced a decrease in its focus on NFTs on Instagram, choosing to concentrate more on AI development and its broader metaverse vision.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The decision to remove the NFT profile picture feature follows a series of crypto-related incidents on Twitter.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a notable event, the official account of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on¬†</span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-chair-gary-gensler-issues-twitter-thread-advising-crypto-investors-ahead-of-potential-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">X was compromised</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, leading to a false announcement regarding the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This breach was attributed to the lack of two-factor authorization and unauthorized access to a linked phone number.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC has since involved the FBI in investigating this cybersecurity lapse.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite Elon Musk&#8217;s decision, NFT Trading Volume Continues to Increase</span></h2>

<p>The <strong>NFT market</strong> on the <strong>Polygon blockchain</strong> network saw considerable growth and renewed interest in December 2023, according to data from market trackers CryptoSlam and DappRadar.</p>
<p><strong>Polygon&#8217;s daily NFT sales volume</strong> spiked to nearly $10 million on December 6‚Äîthe highest single-day volume seen in over six months‚Äîmaking Polygon the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-nft-marketplaces.htm">third-largest NFT market</a> behind Ethereum and Bitcoin for that day.</p>
<h2>MATIC Bulls Charge Ahead Amid Volume Explosion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The increase in NFT trading volume brought about a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/">rise in the MATIC price</a> as well. MATIC gained over 3% in the past 24 hours to trade around $0.83, buoyed by the upbeat Polygon NFT metrics.</p>
<p>Polygon&#8217;s surge also enabled it to flip Solana in terms of NFT sales volume. The takeover started when Solana NFT volume declined 17% to $4.1 million in a day, while Polygon saw its volume jump 42% to hit the $10 million milestone, <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">according to data from CryptoSlam</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings/nft/marketplaces">DappRadar shows</a> that popular Polygon NFTs driving growth include Genesis WildPass, Collect Trump, The Sandbox, and Gas Hero Coupon. Trade volume for these collections has been steadily rising over the past month.</p>
<p>Polygon&#8217;s NFT sales volume is continuing its growth with nearly $40 million in January already.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW:</p>
<p>Polygon nears $40M in NFT sales volume for the month of January only 8 days into the month. <a href="https://t.co/zaklYAoPkN">pic.twitter.com/zaklYAoPkN</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Concerns Remain Despite Volume Comeback</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Some areas of concern are still present within Polygon&#8217;s ecosystem, however. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/chart/address">The number of unique addresses and transaction count declined</a> after peaking on Christmas day, hinting at potential weaknesses.</p>
<p>The rise in <a href="https://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2022-11/cryptowashtrading040521-crypto-wash-trading.pdf">wash trading</a> is also problematic, with reported <strong>wash volume exceeding $850,000</strong> on Polygon. But this pales compared to the $10 million in organic volume, easing some concerns.</p>
<p>Overall, Polygon&#8217;s resurgence signals renewed investor interest in Layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum. With <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-skyrocket-10x-amid-on-chain-panic-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">high Ethereum gas fees</a>, traders are flocking to cheaper alternatives to <strong>mint and trade NFTs</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>MATIC Outperforms Overall Bearish Market</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The crypto markets have suffered heavy declines in 2023, weighed down by macroeconomic headwinds. Yet Polygon and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/polygon-price-prediction-as-attention-shifts-to-matic-next-top-10-coin.htm">MATIC have showcased relative strength</a> amidst the carnage.</p>
<p>MATIC saw prices go up over 35% in the past three months and much of these gains came in December, fueled by the surge in NFT volume and optimism around scaling solutions.</p>
<p>The Q4 performance set MATIC up for an intriguing 2024 as investors bet on winners emerging from the crypto rubble. With NFT and metaverse projects relying on scaling solutions, MATIC and Polygon appear set for further upside.</p>

<p>YouTuber Logan Paul is offering refunds for the never-released <strong>CryptoZoo</strong> NFT game &#8211; if he deems the NFTs eligible &#8220;in his sole discretion.&#8221; Also, former owners relinquish all right to sue.</p>
<p>Announced in 2021, CryptoZoo was supposed to be a play-to-earn (P2E) game where players would buy, sell, breed, and trade exotic animal <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-ministry-of-industry-aims-to-foster-nft-and-dapp-growth-despite-crypto-ban.htm">NFTs</a> with crypto.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am incredibly happy to announce that I am delivering on my promise to buy back Base Egg and Base Animal CryptoZoo NFTs for their original purchase price,&#8221; Paul <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/1742965334645276708">said</a> in a Twitter post.</p>
<p>Eligible NFTs do not include Hybrid animal NFTs.</p>
<p>However, per the terms and conditions:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Any NFTs submitted for the Buy-Back that PAUL in his sole discretion deems ineligible pursuant to this provision will not be returned.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The game will not be released, Paul added, stating that he personally spent $400,000 on it and &#8220;never made a single penny from the project, period.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has committed more than $2.3 million to buy back the NFTs, he wrote, from every person who intended to play CryptoZoo.</p>
<p>&#8220;The buy-back is not intended to compensate those who gambled on the crypto market and lost,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Paul reiterated that CryptoZoo was sabotaged by bad actors who stole money from it. He claims that an extensive investigation has confirmed this.</p>
<p>Subsequently, he has <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bu0WMbW3co-HlXq-HlXbLdpAOZSzJKmf/view">filed a lawsuit</a> in federal court in the US against CryptoZoo lead developers Eduardo Ibanez and Jake Greenbaum.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bitcoin NFTs, also known as Ordinals, are a new type of NFT that exists on the Bitcoin blockchain.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unlike traditional NFTs which are mostly associated with the Ethereum blockchain, Bitcoin NFTs are unique in that they are inscribed directly onto individual satoshis, the smallest unit of a bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More specifically, each Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million satoshis. Bitcoin NFTs are created by inscribing data onto these satoshis.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This process is akin to engraving a tiny piece of data onto a small fraction of a Bitcoin.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum and Solana Trail Behind</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, trailed behind with NFT sales totaling $364.79 million.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BTC-focused NFT sales outperformed ETH&#8217;s by a significant margin, being 2.34 times greater in December.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solana secured the third spot with approximately $325.14 million in NFT sales, experiencing a remarkable 312% increase from the previous month.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Following the top three, Polygon and Arbitrum emerged as the subsequent leading blockchains in terms of NFT sales.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notable NFT Sales of December</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The pinnacle of December&#8217;s NFT transactions featured the sale of a digital copy of Vincent Van Gogh&#8217;s renowned Self-portrait, 1888 (Van Gogh&#8217;s painting #216), which commanded an impressive price of $1.19 million.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another notable sale took place on Ethereum, with the Frxethredemption Ticket #33 fetching $638,433 this month.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite a recent decline in NFT sales, dropping over 35% from the previous week, December witnessed a record-breaking $1.7 billion in NFT transactions.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This marked a significant increase of more than 69% compared to November&#8217;s figures, with Bitcoin continuing to dominate NFT sales across various blockchains.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BTC-based NFT sales soared 127.63% above the chain&#8217;s November totals, as reported by cryptoslam.io statistics.</span></p>
