<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> has recently reversed its downward trend, surpassing the significant $41,000 mark. This resurgence not only bolsters confidence in Bitcoin but also paves the way for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>, Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/Litecoin/">Litecoin (LTC)</a>, all of which have witnessed modest gains.</p>
<p>The overall <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/">crypto market cap</a> now stands at an impressive $1.56 trillion, marking over 0.30% increase in the last 24 hours. This positive momentum in the crypto world is partly attributed to the burgeoning interest in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-etfs.htm">Bitcoin ETFs</a>, a development that underscores the cryptocurrency&#8217;s growing acceptance in mainstream finance.</p>
<p>Concurrently, Tesla&#8217;s unwavering hold on $380 million worth of Bitcoin through Q4 2023 plays a critical role in shaping market sentiment, while the SEC&#8217;s postponement of Grayscale and BlackRock&#8217;s Ethereum ETFs introduces a layer of uncertainty in the ETH market.</p>
<h2>Tesla&#8217;s Q4 2023 Bitcoin Holdings: Influence on BTC Prices</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In Q4 2023, <a href="https://usethebitcoin.com/teslas-q4-2023-earnings-reveal-steady-bitcoin-holdings/">Tesla&#8217;s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings remained steady</a>, as indicated in their recent earnings report released on Wednesday. The report didn&#8217;t mention any Bitcoin transactions, suggesting no buying or selling during the quarter.</p>
<p>Currently valued at $387 million, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-2.htm">Tesla owns approximately 9,720 BTC</a>, ranking as the third-largest public holder after MicroStrategy and Marathon. Tesla initially invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in February 2021, acquiring around 43,000 BTC.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite selling 75% of their holdings in Q2 2022 amid COVID uncertainties, the electric car giant continues to maintain a substantial Bitcoin reserve.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Therefore, Tesla maintaining its Bitcoin holdings in Q4 2023 signals stability, impacting BTC price sentiment positively. With Tesla holding a significant amount, investor confidence in Bitcoin could strengthen, potentially contributing to sustained or increased value.</p>
<h2>SEC Postpones Grayscale, BlackRock Ethereum ETFs: ETH Market Impact</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sec-delays-decision-grayscale-blackrocks-spot-ethereum-etfs-2024-01-25/">postponed</a> a decision on Grayscale Investments&#8217; request to convert its Ethereum trust product (ETHE) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
<p>However, BlackRock&#8217;s similar application also faced a delay. The SEC has been cautious about spot crypto ETFs, recently allowing only spot bitcoin ETFs in January. Therefore, the delay in deciding on Grayscale and BlackRock&#8217;s applications is not unexpected.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In no surprise, the <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SECgov</a> has delayed decisions on spot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/etherETF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#etherETF</a> applications from Grayscale and BlackRock.<a href="https://t.co/hLt54lbv7m">https://t.co/hLt54lbv7m</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1750709597080350851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The filings raise questions about the similarities between spot Ethereum and spot bitcoin ETFs, addressing concerns like market manipulation and the size of the CME futures market. So, this echoes the SEC&#8217;s previous inquiries about bitcoin.</p>
<p>Consequently, the SEC&#8217;s delay in approving spot ether ETFs from Grayscale and BlackRock has introduced uncertainty, potentially impacting Ethereum&#8217;s price. Market participants keenly await regulatory decisions, as approval could positively influence ETH&#8217;s value, while continued delays may introduce volatility.</p>

<p>The latest chart for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) showcases a decisive break from its previous downtrend, marked by a bullish breakout past the critical $40,150 threshold. This movement is reinforced by the formation of bullish engulfing candles, suggesting a strong upward momentum.</p>
<p>The pivot point at this juncture is defined by the green line, situated at $40,957, serving as a fulcrum for price action.</p>

<p>On the downside, Bitcoin has immediate support at $38,618. Should this level be breached, Looking above this pivot, we identify three resistance levels at $41,927, $43,394, and $45,581, delineated by blue lines, which could pose successive hurdles for the ascent.</p>
<p>Conversely, the red lines below the pivot point indicate support levels at $39,998, $39,644, and $38,618, which may offer a foundation for price stabilization in the event of a pullback.</p>

<p>The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) hovers at $2,237.1, providing a dynamic level of potential support.</p>
<p>Current price stability near the pivot point suggests a tussle between bulls and bears, with a breakout above or below this zone likely to dictate the short-term trend.</p>

<p>A new platform named BitcoinOS aimed at bringing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/should-i-buy-bitcoin.htm">Bitcoin</a> into the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape has been introduced by a team of blockchain developers at Sovryn.</p>
<p>The platform, which the developers describe as an “operating system” for Bitcoin, utilizes &#8220;sovryn rollups,&#8221; creating a foundational layer for decentralized applications (dapps) on the Bitcoin network, according to an <a href="https://sovryn.com/all-things-sovryn/bitcoinos-building-in-layers-to-unlock-bitcoins-potential">announcement</a> posted on Sovryn’s website this week.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Does Bitcoin seem frozen in time? Other chains have smart contracts, scaling layers, rollups &#8211; and Bitcoin?</p>

<p>&mdash; Sovryn | DeFi for Bitcoin (@SovrynBTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/SovrynBTC/status/1750534568157872152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This platform, presented as a &#8220;public good,&#8221; allows any developer to contribute and build tools in their preferred programming language.</p>
<p>BitcoinOS will be “be game-changing,” the announcement on Sovryn’s website proclaimed, noting that it combines “rollup flexibility and scalability, ensuring interoperability, and allowing seamless movement of Bitcoin and native assets across systems.”</p>
<p>“BitcoinOS redefines Bitcoin as a global operating system for the world,” the announcement added.</p>
<h2>BitcoinOS increases speed and lower costs of transactions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin&#8217;s primary blockchain, recognized for its high security, has over the years been criticized by some members of the crypto community for its slower transaction speed and higher costs during peak periods.</p>
<p>BitcoinOS aims to address these limitations by providing scalability, programmability, interoperability, and a nearly trustless security model.</p>
<p>The platform&#8217;s fraud system enables even a single honest participant to prevent fraudulent transactions, thereby enhancing security.</p>
<p>Sovryn’s announcement also highlighted that BitcoinOS allows for complete smart contracts, enabling developers to launch their rollups, fostering composability and interoperability among various applications.</p>
<p>The project thus seeks to prevent liquidity silos and enable shared economic activity between different projects, the announcement said.</p>

<p>The crypto market experienced whiplash this week, with Bitcoin and related crypto stocks seeing a sharp selloff followed by a big rebound. After falling below $39,000 early in the week, bitcoin popped back above $42,000 on Friday, lifting crypto-focused stocks with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-sites.htm">Bitcoin mining companies</a> saw the biggest gains, with the likes of <strong>Core Scientific</strong>, <strong>Hut 8</strong>, and <strong>TeraWulf</strong> jumping 15% or more. Other crypto stocks like <strong>Coinbase</strong> and <strong>MicroStrategy</strong>, which hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet, also rallied 3-5%.</p>
<p>The initial catalyst for the selloff was profit-taking after the long-awaited Bitcoin ETF approval, which some saw as a &#8220;sell the news&#8221; event. Outflows from the <strong>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust</strong> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/just-in-ftxs-bankruptcy-estate-sold-22-million-gbtc-shares-leading-to-1-billion-gbtc-outflow.htm">selling pressure from FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy estate</a> added fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>Some analysts view the weakness as temporary, however. 10x Research head of research <a href="https://twitter.com/thielen10x">Markus Thielen</a> believes macro tailwinds will support Bitcoin through 2024. He sees the <strong>U.S. election cycle</strong> prompting constructive fiscal policy that lifts asset prices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if Bitcoin ETF inflows disappoint, this is not the time to turn bearish as the macro environment will remain a tailwind in 2024, and the US election cycle will see a constructive fiscal response that will lift asset prices higher,&#8221; Thielen noted.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>Feast or Famine for Coinbase After Extreme Week</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It was a week of extremes for crypto exchange Coinbase, with wild share price swings after both an upgrade and downgrade from Wall Street in rapid succession.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-analysts-downgrade-coinbase-shares-to-underweight-citing-impact-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">JPMorgan slapped Coinbase with an underweight rating</a> due to disappointing flows into Bitcoin ETFs. This added pressure to an already brutal selloff, pushing Coinbase stock down nearly 10% intraday Tuesday.</p>
<p>But sentiment shifted Thursday after analysts from <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-upgraded-oppenheimer-crypto-exchange-160107023.html">Oppenheimer upgraded Coinbase</a>, citing the exchange&#8217;s strong fundamentals and battle-tested management team. The upgrade helped drive Coinbase shares up 7% Thursday.</p>
<p>Such volatility is par for the course when it comes to crypto stocks. With Coinbase heavily exposed to crypto price action, analysts warn investors should brace for continued turbulence ahead.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Proxy Stock Mirrors Crypto&#8217;s Ups and Downs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
MicroStrategy, which holds billions in Bitcoin on its corporate balance sheet, trades in lockstep with the crypto as a de facto BTC proxy stock.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">MicroStrategy is buying.<br />BlackRock is buying<br />El Salvador is buying<br />Ark is buying<br />billion dollar companies are buying.</p>
<p>And you&#39;re still selling</p>
<p>This will be one of the biggest bullrun in crypto history. In whatever you’re buying make sure you add <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ARC</a> in the bag. Huge AI season</p>
<p>&mdash; Kency₿ (@KencyXBT) <a href="https://twitter.com/KencyXBT/status/1750930435369058360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This week was no exception, with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/mstr">MicroStrategy shares</a> rising and falling in tandem with Bitcoin&#8217;s wild price swings. The stock shed nearly 15% during Bitcoin&#8217;s plunge below $39,000, then rebounded around 8% as BTC popped back above $42,000.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy&#8217;s latest Bitcoin buying spree came in late 2023—between November 30 and December 26—when <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/microstrategy-buys-bitcoin-worth-6157-mln-ahead-secs-spot-etf-decision-2023-12-27/#:~:text=Dec%2027%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Software,exchange%20traded%20fund%20(ETF).">the company scooped up about 14,620 more coins</a> to grow its holdings to around 189,000 BTC.</p>
<p>With such a large crypto position relative to its market cap, MicroStrategy will likely continue to be affected by Bitcoin&#8217;s frequent booms and busts.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto developers just dropped a new tool that lets creators monetize their content with Bitcoin (BTC) – and it&#8217;s a lot more flexible than fiat-based competitors.</p>
<p>Built by programmers Pierre Corbin and Hugo Ferrer, Bitcoin payment gateway “<a href="https://paywithflash.com/">Flash</a>” brings subscriptions, paywalls, and payment links to the digital currency’s native peer-to-peer economy. Aspiring BTC merchants can set up the tool in a minute, and start getting paid in seconds over the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-successfully-integrates-bitcoin-lightning-network-for-faster-cheaper-transactions.htm">lightning network</a>.</p>
<p>“We want to make it the easiest platform to earn in Bitcoin, but also to use Bitcoin in general,” Corbin told <em>Cryptonews</em> via DM. “Today, with a Flash account, you can already &#8220;Pay with Flash&#8221; on our solutions from any device.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Announcing Flash!</p>
<p>For months, <a href="https://twitter.com/HugoFerrer_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HugoFerrer_</a> and I have been experimenting with building AI tools, implementing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nostr?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Nostr</a> and lightning transactions.</p>
<p>And I think we&#39;ve come up with a few innovations.<a href="https://twitter.com/paywflash?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@paywflash</a> is a new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bitcoin</a> payment gateway with a lot of great tools</p>

<p>&mdash; Pierre Corbin (@CierrePorbin) <a href="https://twitter.com/CierrePorbin/status/1750193999854346467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Flash differentiates itself by leveraging the nostr protocol – short for &#8220;notes and other stuff transmitted by relays” – and its brand new open-source P2P payment technology called Nostr Wallet Connect.</p>
<p>The protocol is typically advertised as a decentralized social media network, and is a favorite of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and other prominent Bitcoiners. But given its direct compatibility with the lightning network, Corbin saw it as a perfect user-management system shared between applications that could be used to integrate payments into any app.</p>
<p>As such, any user who onboards Flash will automatically be on nostr, and applications integrating Flash for subscriptions will receive the user’s nostr information: username, about me, profile picture, and public key.</p>
<p>Corbin explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To get set, all a user needs to do is fill in a form, they get an html snippet &lt;script&gt; that can be added to any page, and the product is live, including login and logout buttons, and user information (including subscription plan, payment status, etc).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin Beyond Subscriptions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Alternatively, Flash’s one-time users interacting with its paywalls and payment links can pay using one of four popular lightning wallet options</p>
<p>Flash also includes a first-of-its-kind product called the “video paywall.” Rather than pay to watch videos by the second (ex. a ten-minute portion of a movie) rather than buying the entire video if you don’t plan to watch it.</p>
<p>Users can view their Bitcoin balances and make transactions on Flash, but the platform’s managers never have access to their BTC, instead relying on the lightning network’s existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>“We serve as a software communication service between these wallets, also making us the first true lightning payment gateway (as opposed to processor),” Corbin said.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin (BTC) price is enjoying an end-of-week relief rally in wake of economic data that showed inflationary pressures in the US continued to subside to more acceptable levels in December 2023.</p>
<p>US Core PCE Price Index figures showed YoY inflation falling to 2.9%, below the expected rate of 3.0%.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price was last probing $42,000, up over 5% in the past 24 hours as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-157467" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706290263-screenshot-2024-01-26-122449.png" alt="" width="957" height="563" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706290263-screenshot-2024-01-26-122449.png 957w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706290263-screenshot-2024-01-26-122449-300x176.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706290263-screenshot-2024-01-26-122449-768x452.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706290263-screenshot-2024-01-26-122449-150x88.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/view-mild-dec-us-pce-inflation-wont-divert-fed-easing-2024-2024-01-26/">Core PCE Price Index</a> is the US Federal Reserve’s favored measure of underlying price pressures in the USA.</p>
<p>With inflation in the US trending lower, this opens the door for rate cuts from the Fed this year.</p>
<p>Lower interest rates create a more favorable liquidity environment that can support crypto prices.</p>
<p>That could go some way in explaining why the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin</a> price has pushed higher since Friday’s US market open.</p>
<h2><strong>US Equity Market Rally, ETF Flows Pushing Bitcoin Price Higher?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As per the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html">CME’s Fed Watch tool</a>, US interest rate future market pricing implies a probability of just under 50% that the Fed starts cutting interest rates as soon as March, unchanged from one week ago.</p>
<p>That suggests that, in wake of the latest US inflation figures, macro traders aren’t substantially upping Fed rate cut bets.</p>
<p>That view is further substantiated by looking across traditional asset markets.</p>
<p>The US Dollar Index (DXY) is flat and relatively unchanged on the week in the mid-103s.</p>
<p>The US 10-year yield is flat and relatively unchanged on the week around 4.14%.</p>
<p>If the narrative in traditional asset markets was a build-up of Fed rate cut expectations, one would expect both to be falling.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price could be enjoying tailwinds from US stock prices.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 continues to press to fresh record levels and is now above 4,900.</p>
<p>Positive equity market risk appetite could be spilling over to crypto markets.</p>
<p>Grayscale sales of BTC from its GBTC ETF also appear to have slowed.</p>
<p>The last few days have seen <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/grayscale">Grayscale move 10,000 BTC per day</a> to be sold on exchanges.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, newly launched ETFs from the likes of BlackRock and other asset managers continue to attract substantial flows.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/who-has-the-best-bitcoin-etf-blackrocks-fee-still-a-mystery.htm">BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)</a> surpassed $2 billion in assets under management on Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jp-morgan-spot-bitcoin-etfs-could-see-25-billion-inflows-from-existing-products-without-fresh-capital.htm">JP Morgan</a> argued earlier in the week that sell pressure from Grayscale’s GBTC is “largely behind us” – traders had been buying GBTC throughout 2023 at a discount to net asset value (NAV) on the assumption that it would be converted to a spot ETF, and that GBTC shares would then be directly redeemable for Bitcoin at net asset value.</p>
<p>Traders had been taking profit on this successful trade on masse in wake of GBTC’s conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this month.</p>
<p>But JP Morgan thinks focus now switches to newly launched ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT.</p>
<p>Assuming flows into such funds remain strong, this could underpin the Bitcoin price going forward.</p>
<h2><strong>How High Can the BTC Go?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite the latest rebound, the Bitcoin price remains around 15% down from its recent highs above $49,000.</p>
<p>The latest bounce suggests the 100DMA and November highs around $38,000 both acted as strong support.</p>
<p>But the Bitcoin price may have problems breaking back above its 21 and 50DMAs near $43,000.</p>
<p>Only once Bitcoin is able to break back above its 21 and 50DMAs on a sustained basis could we declare that market momentum has swung decisively bullish once again.</p>
<p>In this case, a retest of yearly highs around $49,000 would be on the cards.</p>

<p>In the months ahead, focus will increasingly shift to the Bitcoin halving and Fed rate cuts.</p>
<p>The latter has historically been an important long-term bullish catalyst for the Bitcoin price.</p>
<p>Fed rate cuts have also historically boosted BTC.</p>
<p>A retest of all-time highs at $69,000 remain on the cards for 2024.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC) mining rig manufacturer, Canaan Inc has raised $50 million in a new funding round by selling preferred shares.</p>
<p>The company disclosed the development in a <a href="https://investor.canaan-creative.com/node/7851/html">recent filing</a> at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stating that funds raised will be deployed to expand research, innovation, and production capacity.</p>
<p>The $50 million raised came from an undisclosed institutional investor after 50,000 series A Canaan shares were issued with convertible preference and at $1,000 each.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Pursuant to the second tranche of the Preferred Shares Financing, the Company issued 50,000 Preferred Shares at the price of US$1,000.00 per Preferred Share and caused The Bank of New York Mellon to deliver 2,800,000 American depositary shares (“ADSs”), each representing fifteen Class A ordinary shares of the Company, at the price of US$0.00000075 for each ADS.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The company explained in the filing that funds raised will be deployed to improve its production capacity with special mention of innovation, research, and other corporate purposes.</p>
<p>This latest round of funding comes on the heels of a previous $25 million raised by the company to further its business operations. At the time of disclosure, the firm&#8217;s share price was up by 7% but suffered a 31% plunge this month.</p>
<h2>Canaan to Improve Bitcoin Mining Capacity Before the Halving</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As mining activity picked up across the board toward the end of last year, miners recorded increased profits, wiping out the previous year&#8217;s losses with the increased revenue.</p>
<p>The company seeks to take advantage of the rush among miners to improve their capacity. This urge is significantly pushed by the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">upcoming Bitcoin halving</a> which will reduce miner rewards.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Bitcoin halvings are known as a bullish drive in the market. Though mining rewards are slashed, miners with increased capacity tend to produce and reap higher price rewards, resulting in multiple miners announcing expansions in Q4 2023.</p>
<p>The firm’s miner sales in Q2 2023 grew by 44% compared to Q1. Revenue was $79.3 million, showing strong year-on-year growth with Canaan&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer James Jin Cheng describing the situation as an improvement.</p>
<p>“<i>Our mining revenue further set a new historic high in the second quarter of 2023. Recently, we have expanded into new mining projects in Africa and South America.”</i><i> </i></p>
<p>In Q3, the company sold <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-miner-manufacturer-caanan-reports-48-drop-in-sales-whats-going-on.htm">3.8 Million Th/s per second</a> of hardware a decrease from its Q2 performance. Still, it announced that it launched the A14 series with a higher computing power alongside securing a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/canaan-diversifies-business-by-becoming-a-bitcoin-miner-in-k-10799.htm">Type 2 license</a> for cryptocurrency mining in Kazakhstan following new industry regulations.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Africa is reportedly preparing to issue the first batch of financial services provider (FSP) licences to crypto service providers.</p>
<p>Gerhard van Deventer, head of enforcement at South Africa’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), confirmed the move <a href="https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/crypto-podcasts/first-crypto-fsp-licences-about-to-drop/">speaking at a podcast</a> on Moneyweb Crypto.</p>
<p>He noted that the move would curb any crypto-related scams. “That will make it easier to shut down crypto scammers before they get started,” he noted.</p>
<p>This is a timely move, as South Africa’s fraud cases on the crypto sector surged by 25% during the last quarter of 2023, per <a href="https://sumsub.com/newsroom/new-african-fraud-statistics-cryptocurrency-fraud-spikes-deepfake-fraud-emerges-and-forced-verification-alarms/">research findings from Sumsub</a>.</p>
<p>Van Deventer further noted that FSCA received applications from 128 crypto firms that are already up and running. According to him, the regulator saw <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-africas-financial-regulator-to-assess-36-crypto-firms-seeking-licenses-in-december.htm">overwhelming responses</a> from crypto service providers between June 1 and November 30, 2023. The regulator opened the registration window following the <a href="https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/202210/47334gen1350.pdf">announcement in October 2022</a>, declaring cryptocurrencies as financial products.</p>
<h1>South Africans Cash Out Cryptos</h1>
<p>The decision for crypto licence approval comes at a time when South Africans are increasingly turning to digital currency payments. Per a <a href="https://www.fsca.co.za/Documents/Crypto%20Market%20Study.pdf">recent data from the FSCA</a>, 10% or 6 million locals hold cryptos in the country.</p>
<p>Also, there has been an increase in South Africans withdrawing cash from crypto ATMs across the nation. This is due to a <a href="https://triple-a.io/newsroom/paycorp-and-triple-a-partner-to-enablecryptoexpress-app-users-to-withdraw-cash-atover-3000-atms-across-south-africa/">recent collaboration</a> between global payment company Paycorp and Triple-A. The partnership allowed users to use their cryptos to make cash withdrawals at over 3,000 ATMs in South Africa.</p>
<p>Furthermore, local crypto service providers are also eagerly anticipating the approval of crypto licences to those who qualify. Christo De Wit, Luno country manager for South Africa, said that the regulators are in the “right direction.”</p>
<p>“The requirement for licensing is a move in the right direction as it validates the operations of crypto companies.”</p>
<p>Another crypto service provider Cedric Jeannot, CEO of neobank Be Mobile Africa that introduced pay-with-crypto option for customers, noted that the move will contribute to the the nation’s growth in the crypto space.</p>
<p>“By introducing licensing, the government is pushing for proper regulation which serves the commercial interests of all parties in the ecosystem positively,” he told a local publication.</p>

<p>According to a recent report by Cantor Fitzgerald, 11 major mining companies, including Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Bitfarms (BITF), would struggle to make a profit post Bitcoin halving in April 2024.</p>
<h2>Non Profitable Mining Business Post Halving</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The report analyzed the “cost-per-coin” of the companies post halving with the steady Bitcoin price set at $40,000. Of all the 13 companies, only two were estimated to maintain their profit margins. Bitdeer (BTDR) mines each coin at the lowest cost of $17,744, while CleanSpark (CLSK) keeps the cost-per-coin just below the $40,000 level at $36,896.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Argo Mining (ARBK) and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) were listed with the highest costs, each calculated at $62,276 and $60,360 respectively.</p>
<p>Cantor Fitzgerald <a href="https://cantor2.bluematrix.com/sellside/EmailDocViewer?encrypt=4a8bc6eb-244e-4846-afb7-d4b74415eee7&amp;mime=pdf&amp;co=cantor2&amp;id=equities_global@cantor.com&amp;source=mail">stated</a> that their research “reflects all the costs that a Bitcoin miner would incur in producing a single Bitcoin, including both electricity costs/hosting fees and other cash expenses.”</p>
<p>Responding to Cantor’s report, CleanSpark executive chairman Matthew Shultz expressed in a post that the key to CleanSpark’s low lost is efficiency.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>“No matter the department, the entire team at CleanSpark is committed to efficiency,” said Shultz. “EFFICIENCY of Uptime, Equipment, Capital, Operations, Community Engagement, Energy, Strategy, Growth, and other metrics.”</p>
<h2>Arthur Hayes: Bitcoin to Find Support in $30,000~$35,000</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Though the analysis established the price benchmark at $40,000, it is trading at $39,932 at the time of writing, down by 0.28% in the past 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, BitMEX founder <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitmex-founder-arthur-hayes-predicts-bitcoin-support-range-at-30000-to-35000.htm">Arthur Hayes</a> has predicted Bitcoin to continue to drop and eventually find support in the range of $30,000 to $35,000.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/yellen-or-talkin">blog post</a>, Hayes stated that he has purchased a Bitcoin put option with a strike price of $35,000 with an expiration date of March 29.</p>
<p>“I think Bitcoin will find a local bottom between $30,000 and $35,000,” said Hayes.</p>
<p>Hayes also speculated that the U.S. Department of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen could have an impact on Bitcoin’s market performance.</p>

This surge aligns with significant developments in the crypto landscape.</p>
<p>Notably, Tesla&#8217;s latest financial disclosure reveals a substantial investment in Bitcoin, with digital assets totaling $184 million on its balance sheet, underscoring a strong corporate endorsement of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Additionally, market analysts from JPMorgan suggest a reduction in selling pressure for Bitcoin, as profit-taking activities on Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appear to be subsiding. However, the scenario is not uniformly optimistic.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald Cantor raises concerns about the future profitability of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-sites.htm">Bitcoin miners</a>, especially in light of the upcoming halving event, which could challenge the financial viability of at least 11 mining entities. These varied factors collectively shape the current and future dynamics of Bitcoin&#8217;s valuation.</p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53, indicating a neutral momentum, while the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) hovers around $40,169, aligning closely with the pivot point. A notable pattern is the extension of a downward channel, with major resistance at $40,275.</p>
<p>A failure to surpass this resistance might signal a bearish trend. The overall market sentiment leans towards a bearish outlook below the $40,275 level, suggesting caution among traders as Bitcoin navigates these critical technical thresholds.</p>

<p>According to Swan Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/swan-bitcoin-unveils-mining-unit/">recent announcement</a>, the “stealth mode” Swan Mining began operating in Summer 2023 and has already mined 750 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-pros-and-cons/">Bitcoins</a> to date. The operation is currently mining at 4.5 exahash per second (EH/s) and aims to exceed 8 EH/s by March 2024.</p>
<h2>Swan&#8217;s New Mining Operation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The 4.5 EH/s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-announces-post-bankruptcy-comeback-to-return-to-nasdaq.htm">mining</a> power means that “around 1 of every 100 Bitcoins mined globally is mined by Swan,” and the company has purchased more equipment for its 8 EH/s goal.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been working hard on a big opportunity that came our way last year, and today, we&#39;re excited to bring our mining operation out of stealth mode.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“Swan Mining developed and deployed at warp speed,” said Rapha Zagury, Swan Bitcoin Chief Investment Officer and Head of Swan Mining. “Our understanding is that this is the fastest-ever initial deployment of hashrate at this scale in Bitcoin history.”</p>
<p>Zagury explained that Swan Mining&#8217;s initial operations were conducted discreetly to prevent influencing the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/australian-regulator-says-cryptos-created-out-of-nothing-issues-fresh-warning-report.htm">Australian Securities and Investments Commission</a> (ASIC) pricing and to align with leading operators in the sector.</p>
<p>The mining unit operates with a funding approach that does not rely on debt. This business strategy ensures a legal and operational separation from Swan&#8217;s other business activities.</p>
<p>The mining division&#8217;s establishment has contributed to the expansion of Swan Institutional. This branch focuses on forming key strategic alliances and offering services like capital raising and balance sheet restructuring, aiming to improve operational and financial performance for its partners.</p>
<p>“We are proud to play a role in keeping Bitcoin mining decentralized,” said Zagury. “With hard work and a little luck, we hope Swan Mining will help to secure the network for many decades.”</p>
<h2>Swan Bitcoin Grows Significantly and Plans Public Listing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the past year, Swan Bitcoin has seen significant growth, doubling its team size and achieving over $125 million in annualized revenue. Looking ahead, the company is planning a Series C <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-bank-sygnum-raises-40-million-for-expansion-and-mergers.htm">funding</a> round.</p>
<p>The capital raised from the C round is expected to be distributed across three main areas: financial services, mining operations, and strategic acquisitions.</p>
<p>In addition, Swan Bitcoin founder and CEO Cory Klippsten stated that the company is “actively working to achieve a public listing within the next 12 months.”</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK’s Supreme Court has denied self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor Craig Wright permission to appeal a ruling in his case against podcaster Peter McCormack, according to a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/01/26/uk-supreme-court-refuses-craig-wright-appeal/">report by CoinDesk</a>.</p>
<p>Wright, who claims to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto was only entitled to £1 in compensation for a libel claim against McCormack in July.</p>
<p>Rupert Cowper-Coles, a partner at law firm RPC who represents McCormack, told CoinDesk, ​​&#8221;We actually only just found out about it but it was at the end of end of last year, [the] Supreme Court refused permission for Craig Wright&#8217;s appeal,&#8221; he added, &#8220;So they&#8217;re very pleased that judgment stands &#8211; [the] one pound nominal damages award, which Craig has tried to appeal twice unsuccessfully.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Who Is Craig Wright? </b></p>
<p>Wright is an Australian computer scientist who has long asserted that he is the pseudonymous author Satoshi Nakamoto, arguing that he owned the copyright to the Bitcoin whitepaper.</p>
<p>Last year a London High Court Judge upheld a ruling that the Bitcoin.org operators, including the pseudonymous Cøbra, must reveal their identities or face substantial legal fees in the legal action brought by Wright. In April 2021, Wright served legal papers on Cøbra, claiming copyright to the Bitcoin white paper and database, as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoinorgs-anon-operator-denied-anonymity-legal-battle-against-craig-wright.htm">reported by</a> Ruholamin Haqshanas from Cryptonews in September.</p>
<p>Cøbra attempted to challenge Wright’s request for £568,516.42 ($704,500) in legal fees, but a London High Court Judge ruled that the pseudonymous user would have to disclose their identity to contest the costs. Cøbra appealed this ruling, but last year London High Court Justice Richard Smith dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p>Justice Smith stated that while there are legitimate reasons for parties to seek anonymity, such as threats to personal safety, Cøbra’s reasons for anonymity appeared “not only unworkable but also risked undermining the very principles of natural justice.” <b> </b></p>
<p><b>Pseudonymous Figures in Crypto </b></p>
<p>Within the crypto community, pseudonymous figures, including prominent community members, developers, and influencers, are common. The cryptocurrency community has long been sceptical of Wright’s claims to be the creator of Bitcoin, and he has faced legal challenges over his claims in the past.</p>
<h4><strong>Wright Pursues Multiple Lawsuits Related to Bitcoin</strong></h4>
<p>It seems over the years Wright has continued to pursue multiple lawsuits worldwide relating to the Bitcoin whitepaper. In 2022, he sued cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Kraken over their misrepresentation of “Bitcoin Core” as the actual Bitcoin. Wright has argued that the real BTC is his Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV).</p>
<p>In April 2023, Wright <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/craig-wright-hints-at-possible-legal-battle-against-apple-over-bitcoin-white-paper-whats-going-on.htm">hinted</a> at a possible legal battle against Apple over the storage of Bitcoin white paper on its computers, claiming it violates copyright laws.  Haqshanas <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoinorgs-anon-operator-denied-anonymity-legal-battle-against-craig-wright.htm">reports,</a> in another blow to Wright’s claim that he is the mysterious Bitcoin creator, a recent investigation provided evidence to suggest that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/investigation-reveals-bitcoins-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-could-group-not-an-individual.htm">Nakamoto may actually be a collective entity</a>.</p>
<p>One piece of evidence is the usage of both “we” and “I” in the Bitcoin white paper, indicating the possibility of a team operating under a singular pseudonym.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> ATM maker Lamassu Industries has successfully addressed a vulnerability that could have granted hackers &#8220;full control&#8221; over its <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-to-launch-a-bitcoin-atm-business-4421.htm">Bitcoin ATM machines</a>.</p>
<p>The flaw came to light when a team of ethical hackers from security firm IOActive attempted to compromise Lamassu&#8217;s Bitcoin ATMs in 2023.</p>
<p>During the process, which the team has <a href="https://labs.ioactive.com/2024/01/atm-security-owning-bitcoin-atm.html">documented</a> online, the researchers identified and exploited several vulnerabilities that allowed them to gain full control over the ATMs.</p>
<p><strong>See how IOActive’s researchers took advantage of the vulnerability in the video below:</strong></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="IOActive Research | Owning a Bitcoin ATM | leveraging the glitch clip" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWLwJkA7fqU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-atm-vulnerability-ethical-hackers">comments</a> shared with Cointelegraph, Gunter Ollman, CTO of IOActive, explained that through the exploit, attackers could &#8220;view and manipulate interactions with the hijacked ATM.&#8221;</p>
<p>This meant that hackers had the potential opportunity to steal Bitcoin from users&#8217; wallets by taking advantage of the identified vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>According to Ollman, a sophisticated attacker could modify the entire user experience, tricking users into performing actions such as entering bank account details.</p>
<p>Ollman assured the community that the attack&#8217;s impact would be limited to a user&#8217;s account balance, but the potential for social engineering was significant.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ATM Vulnerability Gave Hackers ‘Full Control’</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Gabriel Gonzalez, Director of Hardware Security at IOActive, commented that the vulnerability could grant an attacker &#8220;full control&#8221; over a physical ATM machine.</p>
<p>This included the ability to drain all the money in the ATM and manipulate the note reader to display inaccurate deposit amounts, he said.</p>
<p>The security researchers noted the severity of the vulnerabilities, especially if the ATMs were left unattended in various locations.</p>
<p>Lamassu Industries responded promptly to the findings, deploying a security patch to fix the vulnerabilities before they were publicly disclosed in 2024, and told owners of their Bitcoin ATMs to update their software.</p>
<h2>Number of Bitcoin ATMs in decline</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As reported earlier this month, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-atms-see-first-decline-in-a-decade-with-11-drop.htm">number of installed Bitcoin ATMs worldwide fell in 2023</a> after having risen every year for more than a decade.</p>
<p>According to data from Coin ATM Radar, the fall was attributed to a notably lower number of machines in the US from 2022 to 2023, while several other regions of the world saw an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-atms-are-increasing-fees-don-t-change-2505.htm">increasing number of machines</a>.</p>

<p>In a market teeming with activity, <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin&#8217;</a>s latest surge to $40,000, marking a nearly 1% increase on Thursday, has investors and analysts revisiting their <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin price predictions</a>. This uptick comes amidst a flurry of significant developments: Chinese investors, spurred by stock market dynamics, are increasingly engaging with Bitcoin despite its prohibited status in the country.</p>
<p>In a parallel development, the IRS has revised the tax form questions concerning digital assets, signaling a shift towards greater regulatory clarity. Further adding to the ecosystem&#8217;s transparency, Arkham has revealed the onchain addresses associated with four major Bitcoin ETFs, a move that could potentially reshape investor sentiment and market dynamics.</p>
<h2><strong>Chinese Market Trends Drive Bitcoin Engagement</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Amidst the nation&#8217;s economic recession, more and more <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/china-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-stock-market-okx-binance-digital-assets-economic-slump-chainalysis-4072886">Chinese investors are looking to cryptocurrencies</a>, particularly Bitcoin, as a safe haven. Investors are accessing cryptocurrencies through unconventional means and operating in a regulatory gray area as a result of the stock and real estate markets&#8217; downturn. People are trading on sites like OKX and Binance despite China&#8217;s prohibition on cryptocurrency trading and stringent money movement regulations.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of Hong Kong&#8217;s more welcoming climate for cryptocurrencies, the Hong Kong branches of significant Chinese financial institutions, such as Bank of China and China Asset Management, are investigating ventures linked to cryptocurrencies.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; CNA (@ChannelNewsAsia) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChannelNewsAsia/status/1750349931838402896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Due to economic uncertainty, more Chinese investors are turning to digital assets like Bitcoin, seeing its potential in the face of obstacles in the traditional market. This trend could have a favorable effect on Bitcoin prices.</p>
<h2>IRS Revises Digital Asset Stance in Tax Forms</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
All <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/taxpayers-should-continue-to-report-all-cryptocurrency-digital-asset-income#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Internal%20Revenue%20Service,their%202022%20federal%20tax%20returns.">United States taxpayers must record</a> income connected to digital assets on their federal tax return for 2023 as a result of updates and expansions made by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the digital asset question on income tax forms. The updated question, which is now present in four more tax forms, focuses on transactions that incorporate digital assets like stablecoins, cryptocurrencies, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>
<p>The extension of the digital asset inquiry to many tax forms—such as corporations, partnerships, estates, and trusts—highlights the IRS&#8217;s increased emphasis on cryptocurrency tax compliance.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The IRS has issued a reminder that taxpayers must answer a digital asset question on 2023 tax returns, as well as report all digital asset related income when they file their 2023 federal income tax return. <a href="https://t.co/V5XJa4pWdp">https://t.co/V5XJa4pWdp</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Even while the news mostly affects taxpayers&#8217; reporting requirements, greater oversight and regulatory actions in the cryptocurrency industry could have an impact on investor mood, market dynamics, and cryptocurrency prices.</p>
<h2><strong>Arkham Boosts Transparency with Bitcoin ETF Onchain Data</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Four spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) connected to financial firms Blackrock, Fidelity, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton have been discovered by <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/blackrock">Arkham Intelligence</a>. With a focus on blockchain intelligence, the company has now recognized half of the ETFs available in the US market.</p>
<p>The ETFs that have been identified are the Bitwise BITB fund, the Franklin Templeton EZBC ETF, the Blackrock IBIT ETF, and Fidelity&#8217;s Wise Origin spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC). The disclosure improves market openness by offering lucid insights into fund holdings and activities.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking: ETF addresses for Blackrock, Fidelity, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton are now on Arkham.</p>
<p>Arkham has identified the on-chain location of four of the Bitcoin ETFs. We are the first to publicly identify these addresses.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A more transparent bitcoin market is essential to fostering investor confidence and drawing knowledgeable participation. Even though the news mainly affects ETF transparency, it also benefits the integrity of the market as a whole and could have an impact on investor mood and Bitcoin prices.</p>

<p>In the current market landscape, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> is nearing a critical juncture, edging close to its pivot level at $39,947 as shown on the 4-hour chart. The cryptocurrency is encountering initial resistance at $40,884, with further hurdles at $41,791 and an even more significant one at $43,394 that may restrain any price increases.</p>
<p>Conversely, Bitcoin&#8217;s support levels are positioned at $38,618, with additional safety nets at $37,638 and $36,745 if the price were to decline.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI), situated at 38, suggests a balanced field, with no immediate signs of overbought or oversold conditions, leaving room for potential shifts up or down. The 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), at $40,494, hovers just above the pivot point, indicating an ongoing struggle between buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>Technical patterns, including a prominent double top formation with resistance near $39,950, could spell a downturn if Bitcoin doesn&#8217;t manage an upward breach. As it stands, the broader sentiment for Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory is inclined to the downside, particularly if it cannot sustain above the pivotal $40,000 mark.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cathie Wood – CEO of tech-focused investment manager ARK Invest – says her conviction in Bitcoin (BTC) remains unshaken despite the asset’s recent “sell the news” market wipeout.</p>
<p>Bitcoin climbed for four months in a row after Bitcoin asset manager Grayscale bested crypto-skeptical federal regulators in court.</p>
<p>The event bolstered market confidence that a Bitcoin spot ETF would finally launch in the United States within the next few months. Yet after the product finally hit the market earlier this month, the asset’s bullish momentum quickly turned around.</p>
<p>“We’re very excited that Bitcoin is now in the ETF wrapper, and therefore very accessible at very low prices,” said Wood during an interview with CNBC on Wednesday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Wood’s investment firm owns one of nine new Bitcoin ETFs to launch on January 11. After eight days of trading, the fund holds $480 million in assets.</p>
<p>The CEO said that Ark expected a sell the news event after the launch, noting how bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has already sold nearly $1 billion worth of shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</p>
<p>“I think some people expected [Bitcoin’s price] to hold a little more than it has,” she said. “But this has not disturbed our point of view at all.”</p>
<p>Wood went on to call Bitcoin “one of the most important investments of our lifetimes,” highlighting its specialty as a global, rules-based monetary system. “We think its the biggest of all the crypto ideas out there,” she added.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin VS Altcoins</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin’s origins lie in an attempt by cryptographers to create a fairer form of money in response to bank bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis. The asset’s wealthiest promotors like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink now characterize it as “digital gold,” with its absolutely fixed supply of 21 million coins.</p>
<p>Fidelity, fund manager with a popular Bitcoin ETF, published a <a href="https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/sites/default/files/documents/bitcoin-first.pdf">report</a> in January 2022 claiming Bitcoin should be “considered separately from other digital assets.” Nevertheless, both Fidelity and BlackRock are currently pining to launch a spot Ethereum ETF, pending regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton has also taken a multi-chain approach to crypto. The asset manager has donned laser-eyes in its profile picture on X, and <a href="https://twitter.com/FTI_US/status/1747719379373162565">claimed</a> that it is continuing to monitor and support networks beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.</p>

<p>On January 24, <strong>Bitwise Asset Management</strong> took a major step toward transparency by releasing the <strong>Bitcoin wallet addresses</strong> linked to its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. This voluntary disclosure gives direct access to view assets on the blockchain, a first for a U.S. spot <strong>Bitcoin ETF</strong> provider.</p>
<p>“Onchain transparency is core to Bitcoin&#8217;s ethos. We&#8217;re proud to walk the walk,” <a href="https://twitter.com/BitwiseInvest/status/1750224060620111912">Bitwise said</a>.</p>
<p>The move highlights Bitwise’s commitment to accountability and trust. Publishing addresses enables investors and regulators to independently verify holdings and flows.</p>
<h2>Bitwise Leads Charge for Bitcoin ETF Transparency</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“As infrastructure evolves, we hope to do more, like work with firms to enable real-time cryptographic attestations,” Bitwise stated.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Publishing on-chain addresses is a first step toward increasing public transparency. As infrastructure evolves, we hope to do more, such as working with firms like <a href="https://twitter.com/hosekiapp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@hosekiapp</a> to provide real-time cryptographic attestations.</p>
<p>&mdash; Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitwiseInvest/status/1750224062100701364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The principles guiding this transparency reflect <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-faces-sec-pressure-for-financial-transparency-in-ongoing-legal-saga.htm">growing calls for openness in crypto finance</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, following long anticipation, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-frenzy-begins-as-sec-finally-approves-first-spot-bitcoin-funds-bitcoin-remains-unresponsive.htm">SEC approved U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>. Bitwise rapidly advanced transparency for these new vehicles. The ETFs have already seen billions in demand, becoming the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/01/24/bitcoin-overtakes-silver-as-second-largest-etf-commodity/#:~:text=Contributor,Bitcoin%20Journalist%20and%20Financial%20Analyst.&amp;text=Bitcoin%20ETFs%20have%20marked%20a,in%20a%20remarkably%20short%20timeframe.">second largest ETF commodity</a>.</p>
<h2>Bitwise Distinguishes Itself Among ETF Providers</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
By spearheading address disclosure, Bitwise distinguishes itself among competitors in the Bitcoin ETF market. Peers may feel compelled to follow this example.</p>
<p>Bitwise&#8217;s move even sparked calls for <strong>Gold ETF transparency</strong> as well.</p>
<p><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">&#8220;This is now the absolute most transparent investment product in the US. I wish we could have a live view into the gold ETF vaults at all times,&#8221;</span><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"> reinsurance broker <a href="https://twitter.com/PunterJeff/status/1750229521045815410">Jeff Punter tweeted</a>. &#8220;Do gold ETFs plan on this level of transparency any time soon?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>For an asset class known for anonymity, the address reveal could be impactful. Bitwise set new openness precedents for not just U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, but all investment products. Following Bitwise&#8217;s move, voluntary transparency could become standard industry practice. For now, Bitwise’s address disclosure is seen as a defining leap forward.</p>

As of recent developments, Bitcoin, the pioneer and most valued cryptocurrency, experienced a significant downturn, breaching the $40,000 mark and stirring market uncertainty.</p>
<p>This decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s value, partly attributed to the sales associated with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gbtc-etf-sees-another-515m-in-outflows-as-bitcoin-price-remains-below-40k.htm">Grayscale GBTC Bitcoin ETF</a>, has sparked concerns among traders about a possible further drop to the $38,000 level.</p>
<p>Concurrently, the global crypto market cap witnessed a 2.32% fall within 24 hours, settling at $1.54 trillion, underscoring the broader impact of Bitcoin&#8217;s fluctuation.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, Ethereum, renowned as the second-largest cryptocurrency, wasn&#8217;t spared from the bearish trend. It saw a nearly 3% decline, dropping to $2,347, a movement seemingly influenced by Bitcoin&#8217;s 20% fall following the launch of ETFs by major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity.</p>
<p>Amidst these market dynamics, Google Bard&#8217;s AI projections suggest a potential further decrease in Bitcoin&#8217;s value to $35,000, considering various economic factors such as inflation, interest rates, and regulatory changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Navigating the Uncertainties: Key Factors Influencing Bitcoin and Ethereum in the Current Market Landscape</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The current state of the cryptocurrency market, particularly concerning Bitcoin and Ethereum, is influenced by a complex web of factors, leading to considerable uncertainty. Analysts at QCP Capital have their eyes set on the potential for Ethereum to climb, especially with the prospects of spot ETF approvals.</p>
<p>The uncertainty surrounding Ethereum ETF approvals in 2024 has become a focal point, with analysts speculating that patterns in SEC approval may provide valuable insights.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<ul>
<li>The recent dip in Bitcoin&#8217;s value is attributed partly to outflows from Grayscale and the unfolding Mt. Gox news, which have sparked a flurry of questions in the market.</li>
<li>With Grayscale managing an impressive $21 billion in assets under management (AUM), its movements could significantly impact Bitcoin&#8217;s supply dynamics.</li>
<li>Analysts are closely monitoring the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA).</li>
</ul>
<p>They anticipate that a strategy leaning towards short-term debt issuance could lead to market rallies. However, an increase in long-term debt could result in higher bond yields and potentially trigger sell-offs in the stock market.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, a scenario favoring short-term debt would be more conducive to gains in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In light of these developments, there remains a cloud of uncertainty over Ethereum (ETH), albeit with a silver lining that spot ETH approvals could have a positive impact.</p>
<p>The trajectory of ETH will likely hinge on a range of factors, including the outcome of ETF approvals, the influence of Grayscale&#8217;s market maneuvers, and broader macroeconomic events. This complex interplay of variables contributes to a cautious sentiment prevailing in the market.</p>
<h2>Arthur Hayes&#8217; Market Insights</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Arthur Hayes, co-founder, and former CEO of BitMEX, recently shared thoughts on Bitcoin. He predicts a 30% drop from the recent high, expecting Bitcoin to go down to $30,000-$35,000. Hayes mentions buying &#8220;Put Options&#8221; at $35,000, expecting a 10-15% decline.</p>

<p>Despite challenges, he believes the Federal Reserve could provide relief, highlighting cryptocurrencies as important for inflation protection. He sold Solana (SOL) and BONK but trusts Dogwifhat (WIF) if Bitcoin goes below $35,000, sticking to his recovery outlook for the market.</p>

<p>As of the latest technical analysis, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin</a> is currently hovering around a critical juncture at the $40,000 mark, which could be a decisive factor for its forthcoming price trends. The presence of a downward wedge pattern raises concerns about increased selling pressure if Bitcoin falls beneath this pivotal level.</p>
<p>Bitcoin encounters resistance at $40,850, $41,381, and $43,394. These barriers could interrupt any downward trends and set the stage for a potential corrective rebound.</p>

<p>On the downside, Bitcoin has immediate support at $38,618. Should this level be breached, further significant support can be found at $37,638 and $36,745, potentially mitigating deeper declines.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently in an oversold state, indicates a potential bullish correction might be on the horizon, possibly reaching the first or second resistance level in the near term.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this potential rally may be ephemeral if the overarching bearish trend continues, potentially leading Bitcoin to explore lower support levels once more.</p>

<p>The position of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2,415.7, recently crossed below, adds a bearish tint to Ethereum&#8217;s outlook.</p>
<p>However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 26, suggesting the market is oversold and might be primed for a corrective rally, potentially retesting the pivotal $2,250.1 level.</p>
<p>Market participants are keeping a vigilant eye on these critical points, as a breach or rebound from these levels could indicate the future direction of Ethereum&#8217;s price movement.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>The Commissioner of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Hester Peirce, seemed to express remorse over the federal agency&rsquo;s handling of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in a recent interview.</span></p>
<h2><span>Peirce says Ethereum ETF will not follow suit</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>&ldquo;We squandered a decade of opportunities to do our job,&rdquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/zGuz/status/1749835221858385968">Peircce told Coinage&rsquo;s Zack Guzm&aacute;n</a>. &ldquo;If we had applied the standard we use for other commodity-based ETPs, we could have approved these products years ago, but we refused to do so until a court called our bluff.&rdquo;</span><span>When asked by Guzm&aacute;n if another court case is going to have to happen in order to get Ethereum ETFs approved, Peirce rejected the notion.</span><span>&#8220;That&#8217;s not how we&#8217;re going to do our approvals,&rdquo; Peirce told Guzm&aacute;n. &ldquo;We shouldn&#8217;t need a court to tell us that our approach is &lsquo;arbitrary and capricious&rsquo; in order for us to get it right.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span>Gensler&rsquo;s tone</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>The Commissioner&rsquo;s comments come nearly two weeks after the SEC approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs, ending a years-long attempt at approval.</span><span>However, not everyone seemed to share in Peirce&rsquo;s candor regarding the matter.</span><span>&ldquo;While we approved the listing and trading of certain<a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-history/"> spot Bitcoin ETP</a> shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin,&rdquo; SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement shortly following the federal agency&rsquo;s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. &ldquo;Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.&rdquo;</span><span>Gensler has faced wide-ranging scrutiny for his handling of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, particularly in regards to a hack on SEC&rsquo;s X account 24 hours prior that resulted in an unauthorized party creating a fraudulent post claiming the federal agency had already approved a number of the aforementioned ETFs.</span><span>On Monday, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/secgov-x-account">the SEC announced</a> that the hack was due to a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-blames-social-media-account-hack-on-sim-swap-attack-in-fake-bitcoin-etf-post.htm">&ldquo;SIM swap&rdquo; attack,</a> made possible in part by the federal agency turning off multi-factor authentication on their account due to access issues.</span></p>
<h2><span>Everyone&rsquo;s a critic</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Most recently, Gensler faced criticism from <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-ceo-brad-garlinghouse-says-gensler-is-a-political-liability-report.htm">Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse</a> during an appearance at the World Economic Forum.</p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I do think the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, is a political liability in the United States,&rdquo; Garlinghouse told</span> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/16/ripple-ceo-calls-us-sec-chair-gary-gensler-a-political-liability.html?taid=65a656a3e3a6540001804cba&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter%7Cmain%5C%22"><span>CNBC&rsquo;s Arjun Kharpal</span></a><span>. &ldquo;And I think he&rsquo;s not acting in the interests of the citizenry, he&rsquo;s not acting in the interests of the long-term growth of the economy, and I don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I think at some point there will be a new chair of the SEC, and I think that will be a good thing for the American people,&rdquo; Garlinghouse continued.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The renowned financial services firm Franklin Templeton remains optimistic about the future of its spot Bitcoin ETF despite not yet achieving significant trading volumes compared to industry giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale.</p>
<p>While these major players account for about 90% of total trading volume in the spot Bitcoin ETF space, Franklin Templeton believes its product will gain traction. Interest could spike as financial advisors and investors become more familiar with the offering, crypto news outlet The Block <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/274149/franklin-templeton-expects-its-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-gain-traction-as-financial-advisors-become-more-familiar-with-product">reported</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Speaking with The Block, Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, expressed confidence in the spot Bitcoin ETF&#8217;s potential popularity and said education is key to showcasing how these assets complement existing portfolios. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s just a matter of time […] as education moves forward about how these assets complement and help deliver potentially better long-term solutions alongside other assets in their portfolio.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Bayston highlighted the product&#8217;s novelty and the platforms&#8217; fiduciary responsibilities in filtering through providers to ensure clients achieve the best long-term results.</p>
<p>According to data on X on Tuesday by Bloomberg Intelligence’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, Franklin Templeton’s ETF with the ticker EZBC is the third to last by total flows, with $56 million in net inflows.</p>
<p>The leader among the new spot Bitcoin ETFs is the BlackRock/iShares fund, with $1.69 billion in net inflows.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">LATEST: The Great GBTC Gouge hit record -$640m on Monday, the Nine did their best to offset but fell short w/ a $553m haul. ROLLING NET FLOWS still healthy at +$1b but ongoing battle. The Nine now have a 20% share vs GBTC. Volume also remains very high for new launches in 2nd wk <a href="https://t.co/ng0BU8mi6L">pic.twitter.com/ng0BU8mi6L</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1749779901807272142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Franklin Templeton&#8217;s business revolves around collaborating with financial advisors to provide solutions for end clients.</p>
<p>Bayston’s view is in line with predictions from the independent investment bank and asset management firm Needham, which last month said <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/advisors-may-drive-bitcoin-etf-flows-in-usa-more-news.htm">Registered investment advisors (RIAs) will likely drive the Bitcoin ETFs</a> once they are <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-frenzy-begins-as-sec-finally-approves-first-spot-bitcoin-funds-bitcoin-remains-unresponsive.htm">approved in the US</a>.</p>
<h2>Franklin Templeton to Become Crypto ‘Provider of Choice’</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In the interview with The Block, Bayston said he envisions his firm becoming a &#8220;digital asset provider of choice&#8221; as familiarity with spot Bitcoin ETFs grows within the investment community.</p>
<p>Despite starting with relatively modest trading volumes, Bayston said he believes Franklin Templeton will stand out among competitors.</p>
<p>He pointed out the firm&#8217;s commitment to digital assets, including building within the public blockchain community, as a key differentiator, saying this approach provides the firm with a unique understanding of the blockchain infrastructure compared to other providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea that we offer deep investment services and research across the entire digital asset space is another differentiator,&#8221; Bayston said.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The RARI Foundation has launched the mainnet for RARI Chain on Arbitrum. Built with Caldera by leveraging an Orbit chain, RARI Chain utilizes the Arbitrum Nitro tech stack, introducing a unique feature of embedding royalties on the sequencer level.</p>
<p>For the launch of mainnet, <a href="https://rari.foundation/">Rari Foundation</a>, Rarible, HUG, Aniko Berman and Justin Gilanyi present a series of open edition collection drops from ten digital artists, featuring Alien Queen, Amber Vittoria, Andre Oshea, among others.</p>
<h2>RARI Chain’s Governance Will be Overseen by RARI DAO</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Designed to address scalability challenges inherent in the NFT space, RARI Chain operates as a Layer 3 network on Ethereum. The strategic design allows for customizable rules and independent governance mechanisms, tailored to the specific needs of NFTs as the platform scales. Governance will be overseen by the RARI DAO, with active participation from $RARI token holders.</p>
<p>Jana Bertram, Head of Strategy at RARI Foundation, said in a statement shared with Cryptonews:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The launch of RARI Chain mainnet turns our vision of creating an NFT specific, creator-focused chain, that becomes home for the creator economy, into a reality.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Royalty Embedded NFTs for Creators</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Royalties, a crucial aspect of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-news/">NFT</a> value, are embedded on the node level, ensuring creators receive fair compensation. The mainnet offers a secure environment, low transaction costs, and fast block finality, making it conducive for mass NFT projects and users.</p>
<p>Rari Foundation noted that strategic partners like Rarible, LayerZero, Celestia, and Arbitrum played key roles in the RARI Chain Mainnet launch, providing foundational infrastructure for creators and developers. Rarible.com aims to integrate assets seamlessly onto the RARI Chain, enhancing the user experience.</p>
<p>RARI is working towards establishing a grants fund and a Creator Fund, fostering community-driven NFT innovation. The successful testnet phase engaged over 46,000 wallets and processed 251,000 transactions.</p>

<p>The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued a reminder to all taxpayers to report any crypto-related income. The tax regulator has included a digital asset question on 2023 tax return Form 1040.</p>
<p>The question asks taxpayers to report cryptos received in 2023 as a reward, award or payment for property or services. “Everyone who files Forms 1040, must check one box answering either &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221; to the digital asset question,” the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/taxpayers-should-continue-to-report-all-cryptocurrency-digital-asset-income">Monday announcement</a> read.</p>
<p>IRS stressed that it is mandatory for all taxpayers to answer the question when they file their 2023 federal income tax return and not only for those who engaged in a crypto transaction.</p>
<h1>Who Should Report?</h1>
<p>Citizens who have received cryptos as a reward or from mining and staking or through a hard fork, must answer ‘yes’ to the question, it added. Additionally, those who disposed of cryptos in exchange for property, services, or sold any, should also reflect in their filing.</p>
<p>“In addition to checking the ‘yes’ box, taxpayers must report all income related to their crypto transactions,” the note read. This includes digital assets held as capital assets, sold, transferred or exchanged during 2023.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If an employee was paid with digital assets, they must report the value of assets received as wages. Similarly, if they worked as an independent contractor and were paid with digital assets, they must report that income.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, IRS cleared that taxpayers who merely owned cryptos in 2023 can check ‘no’ to the question. However, HODLers should not have engaged in any transactions involving digital assets during the year, it added.</p>
<p>Furthermore, transferring cryptos from one wallet to another, both owned by the same taxpayer, does not reflect in the filing. These tax reporting law applies to cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, altcoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>
<p>In a previous announcement this month, IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-and-irs-announce-that-businesses-do-not-have-to-report-certain-transactions-involving-digital-assets-until-regulations-are-issued">mandated businesses</a> to report receiving cash or digital assets worth more than $10,000 within 15 days of the transaction. It further said that businesses need not have to report the receipt of digital assets the same way as they must report the receipt of cash until regulations are issued.</p>
<p>The rules have <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-investors-beware-irs-crypto-tax-reporting-rules-for-10k-transactions-now-in-effect.htm">drawn criticism</a> for being vague and difficult to comply with. Jerry Brito, executive director at cryptocurrency policy think tank Coin Center, noted at the time that many crypto users “will find it <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/new-crypto-tax-reporting-obligations-took-effect-on-new-years-day/">difficult to comply</a>” with the “tricky” reporting requirements.</p>
