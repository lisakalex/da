<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The legal battle between Binance and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to intensify as court documents shed light on the clash over evidence production and witness depositions in the SEC&#8217;s case against the leading cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>According to a joint status report <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67474542/211/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-binance-holdings-limited/">filed</a> on January 25, the SEC alleges that BAM Trading Services, the parent company of Binance.US, has not fully complied with its information requests. The regulatory body seeks detailed insights into the custody and liquidity of assets, expressing concerns that Binance.US might have undisclosed control mechanisms over customer funds, reminiscent of the FTX scandal.</p>
<p>BAM&#8217;s attorneys vehemently refute these allegations, asserting that the company has adhered to all document production requirements stipulated in the consent order and the expedited recovery request. They argue that the SEC&#8217;s methods, including issuing a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and pursuing expedited discovery, have imposed an undue burden on BAM.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;At that point, BAM believes it will have more than reasonably complied with its obligations under the Consent Order and requests that expedited discovery be deemed complete as to BAM, particularly given how much harm and burden the SEC&#8217;s TRO and approach to expedited discovery has caused BAM over the past seven months.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Initially established to govern the SEC&#8217;s investigation, the consent order has become a focal point of contention. BAM contends that the SEC is exceeding the agreed terms, expanding its probe beyond the safety and accounting of customer assets. The company claims that the SEC is now delving into a broad examination of BAM&#8217;s custody policies and practices. This assertion adds another layer of complexity to the already intricate legal battle.</p>
<p>The regulator is reportedly seeking evidence related to concerns that Binance.US may have had a backdoor allowing potential control over customer assets, akin to the situation with FTX. Attorneys for BAM assert that they have fully complied with document production requirements as specified in the consent order and expedited recovery request.</p>
<h2><b>SEC Requests Depositions from Binance.US&#8217;s Former CEO and CFO in Lawsuit</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The report further highlights pending requests for depositions from BAM Trading Services&#8217; former CEO and CFO, believed to be Brian Shroder and Jasmine Lee.</p>
<p>BAM Trading Services, the parent company of Binance.US, argues that additional depositions from its current or former personnel are unnecessary. The company points to the SEC&#8217;s prior deposition of numerous witnesses during the expedited discovery phase, asserting that the regulator has already gathered sufficient information.</p>
<p>BAM attorneys stated that the SEC&#8217;s motion &#8220;does not identify any evidence&#8221; that Shroder and Lee are involved in the day-to-day management details concerning the custody and transfer of customer assets at Binance.US.</p>
<p>BAM&#8217;s CEO and CFO have no unique knowledge regarding facts relevant to the limited topics identified in the consent order&#8217;s expedited discovery provision,&#8221; the lawyers said. The attorneys also said that BAM has offered many other witnesses who have more insights about BAM&#8217;s operations, including BAM chief information security officer Erik Kellogg.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;BAM does not believe that the SEC is entitled to any additional depositions from current or former BAM personnel because, among other reasons, the SEC has already deposed a dozen witnesses during expedited discovery.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>The lawyers noted the burden imposed by these depositions far outweighs their potential benefit, and the discovery sought is disproportionate to the needs contemplated by the consent order.</p>
<p>In September, the SEC and Binance agreed on a protective motion requiring parties to file confidential information under seal. The plaintiff and the defendants <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67474542/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-binance-holdings-limited/#entry-107">submitted</a> a joint motion pledging to file confidential and non-public information as protected materials, restricting access to parties such as the judge, attorneys, plaintiffs, and defendants.</p>
<p>Another point of contention is the potential examination of Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/secs-absence-at-binance-settlement-announcement-raises-questions.htm">Disagreements</a> persist over the specifics of Zhao&#8217;s deposition, including its scope, timing, and location. Zhao resigned as CEO of Binance in November 2023, following a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. regulators.</p>
<p>His sentencing is scheduled for February 23, 2024, while the next status report on the case is expected by February 15. Zhao is currently free on a $175 million bond in the United States, facing a potential 18 months in prison.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PAMBO, the native cryptocurrency of trailblazing blockchain project Pandoshi, is currently in its initial presale period. It’s being offered at discounted rates before eventual public exchange listings. Just weeks into its presale, Pandoshi has already raised over $2 million from high investor demand. The token is skyrocketing into the mainstream market with millions talking about it every day all around the globe.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re one of those millions of people thinking about investing in this project, you&#8217;ve come to the right place. This article will go over everything you need to know about the current trajectory of Pandoshi, informing you of all the pertinent details.</p>
<h2>Presale Phase 4 May End Earlier than Initially Predicted</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The present phase 4 of Pandoshi&#8217;s presale is already approaching the maximum capacity reached in the previous phase 3. With the majority of the limited phase 4 supply sold through in just the last 5 days, purchase allotments are shrinking rapidly.</p>
<p>If things continue at this rate, phase 4 could sell out fully in potentially days rather than weeks as initially projected, forcing the presale event to conclude earlier than expected. This enormous early reception underscores the hype surrounding Pandoshi&#8217;s future potential.</p>
<h2>Key Presale Details for Potential Investors</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Out of two billion tokens, Pandoshi has strategically set half (a billion) PAMBO tokens for public presale availability with segmented pricing tiers based on phases to incentivize early participant entry. Phase 1 to 3 have already concluded, while Phase 4 is ongoing but quickly reaching its end due to the low price of $0.008.</p>
<p>As the project progresses, it is poised to enter its next and concluding phase, where the token price is anticipated to rise to $0.01. This marks a significant milestone for Pandoshi.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshicrpnews10" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-156115" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706116241-pambo-banner.png" alt="" width="512" height="80" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706116241-pambo-banner.png 512w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706116241-pambo-banner-300x47.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706116241-pambo-banner-150x23.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></p>
<h2>PAMBO Presale Discounts Are Hard to Ignore</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Pandoshi quotes eventual exchange debuts will price anywhere in the range of 10X to 100X of its price at phase 5 ($0.01 per PAMBO). So capitalizing on closing presale entry poses the most direct path to seizing such lucrative early buyer gains. The potential of investing in the early presale is just too hard to ignore as it will be near impossible to mirror the gains being made right now once the token hits the official exchange listings.</p>
<h2>Key Developments Fueling Presale Demand</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Pandoshi&#8217;s impressive presale reception mirrors its pace of development, having already launched its decentralized non-custodial <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshiwallet">Pandoshi Wallet</a> ahead of schedule. The functional non-custodial <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pandoshiwallet">Pandoshi Wallet</a> supporting crypto on-ramps spotlights the team&#8217;s execution capacity. As promises are being fulfilled earlier than anticipated, it’s no wonder people are lining up to invest their hard earned money into a project they can trust.</p>
<p>Further demos and app unveils are imminent as Pandoshi shifts closer to full mainstream deployment. These promising undertakings are galvanizing investor activity to grab presale PAMBO tokens while possible, before inaccessibility after sell-out.</p>
<h2>Now’s the Perfect Time to Secure Holdings</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With Phase 4 capacity selling through expeditiously based on surging demand, the remaining Pandoshi presale window is closing much faster than envisioned. Just weeks likely remain before conclusion and exchange debuts commence.</p>
<p>Prospective buyers should act quickly to purchase PAMBO tokens at current basement-level presale rates before market rates adjust prices higher later on. The implications of this small token supply selling out cannot be overstated enough for investors seeking monumental gains.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has shown promising signs of strength today, with<strong> Bitcoin</strong> climbing 5% to trade around <strong>$42,000</strong>. This upward momentum has provided further tailwinds for altcoins like <strong>Chiliz (CHZ)</strong>, which has surged 25% over the past month. With major partnerships and developments in the pipeline, Chiliz has risen as a top contender for the <strong>best crypto to buy now</strong> for investors looking to capitalize on the renewed optimism and buy the dip.</p>
<p><strong>Conflux Network (CFX)</strong> has also made strides by unveiling an <strong>EVM-compatible Bitcoin Layer 2 solution</strong>, sparking a 30% price uptick for the past week. Additionally, <strong>Optimism&#8217;s OP token</strong> has also shown resilience despite the bearish market trends for the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Beyond established cryptos, up-and-coming crypto projects like <strong>Bitcoin Minetrix</strong> and <strong>Meme Kombat</strong> have been gaining traction in their presale phases. Their developments have intrigued many looking for early investment opportunities in the space.</p>
<p>With cryptocurrencies like CHZ, CFX, and OP making moves alongside fresh players, the cryptocurrency market continues to progress. Staying informed on these trends can help identify the best crypto to buy now.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Now in the News</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chiliz has made headlines with its aggressive expansion strategy and innovative developments on its blockchain platform. The CHZ token&#8217;s 18% weekly price gain, which marks a 7-month peak, is a response to a dynamic approach that includes a revamp of its tokenomics. The proposed changes involve a <strong>burn system</strong>, staking rewards, and the inclusion of external consultants to refine the economic model.</p>
<p>Additionally, the integration with the <strong>Rarible Protocol</strong> is set to elevate the NFT marketplace on the Chiliz Chain. This integration will likely enhance digital collectibles and user engagement, contributing to the token&#8217;s growing appeal.</p>
<p>The transition to a full-fledged <a href="https://cryptonews.com/gambling/best-online-sportsbooks/">Web3 blockchain for sports and entertainment</a> underpins Chiliz&#8217;s evolution and underscores its strong market performance, even in the face of current market challenges.</p>

<p>The <strong>CHZ price</strong> has shown bullish momentum in recent days, bouncing back from consolidation to post gains. After ranging sideways for a week and forming an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ascendingtriangle.asp#:~:text=An%20ascending%20triangle%20is%20a,two%20lines%20form%20a%20triangle.">ascending triangle pattern</a>, the CHZ price broke out to the upside yesterday with a 10.97% surge. CHZ built on this momentum today, setting a new 7-month high of $0.11637 earlier in the session.</p>
<p>However, it appears selling pressure is substantial around immediate resistance levels. The CHZ price has pulled back from its intraday peak and is currently trading at $0.11001, although still up 2.13% so far today.</p>
<p>The 20-day EMA for the CHZ price stands at $0.09473 while the 50-day EMA is at $0.08817. With the short-term EMA above the long-term EMA, this signals a bullish trend in motion. The widening gap between the EMAs shows buying momentum is accelerating for CHZ.</p>
<p>The RSI has climbed to 62.75 from yesterday&#8217;s 61.55. This shows growing strength behind the uptrend as the CHZ price leaves oversold territory. The MACD histogram has also increased to 0.00170 from 0.00140, reflecting building bullish momentum.</p>
<p>The CHZ price currently faces immediate resistance between $0.10836 and $0.11186. CHZ initially surged above this zone to its new 7-month high but heavy selling pressure has since forced the price back below resistance.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support lies between $0.10456 and $0.10582. Below this, the CHZ price has further horizontal support from $0.10195 to $0.10341. This zone aligns with the Fib 0.236 level at $0.10193, making it a critical support area to watch.</p>
<p>With technicals signaling growing upward momentum but the CHZ price struggling to overcome resistance, the coin appears positioned for a breakout. A sustained move above $0.112 could see CHZ extend towards its next resistance around $0.125.</p>
<p>Alternatively, rejection here risks a pullback towards the key support zone around $0.102. Traders may look to enter on a confirmed break above or below these levels.</p>

<p>The <strong>CFX price</strong> has shown promising signs of upward momentum in recent trading after consolidating between $0.1624 and $0.2361 for almost two months. With today&#8217;s 18.83% gain so far, the CFX price looks set to challenge crucial resistance levels that could determine its next major move.</p>
<p>Technical indicators paint an increasingly bullish picture for the CFX price after crossing into overbought territory. The RSI has surged to 63.27, up sharply from yesterday&#8217;s 50.27 reading. This shows growing positive momentum. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram has turned positive at 0.0016, crossing above the prior day&#8217;s -0.0010 reading. This crossover often precedes further upside.</p>
<p>As the CFX price pushes further past the $0.22 level, it faces immediate upside barriers. This includes the Fib 0.382 and 0.236 levels of $0.1968 and $0.2095, along with the current swing high resistance between $0.2218 and $0.2301 where the price is trading around currently. Clearing these levels could pave the way for an impulsive move up to the next resistance at $0.2407 to $0.2484.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support lies at the 20-day EMA of $0.1906 and the 50-day EMA of $0.1853. However, with today&#8217;s bullish price action, the Fib 0.382 and 0.236 levels of $0.1968 and $0.2095 could turn into new support zones.</p>
<p>With the CFX price breaking out of its trading range, bulls seem to be regaining control. Sustained trading above $0.22 resistance would confirm the uptrend and open the door for a retest of $0.24. Cautious traders may wait for a pullback to the $0.20 area to get on board.</p>
<h2>Op Price Prediction: Steady Recovery After Major Retracement</h2>

<figure id="attachment_157540" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157540" style="width: 1790px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-157540" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706304210-01-26-24-cn-op-chart.png" alt="Optimism OP price chart in tradingview" width="1790" height="761" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706304210-01-26-24-cn-op-chart.png 1790w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706304210-01-26-24-cn-op-chart-300x128.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706304210-01-26-24-cn-op-chart-1024x435.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706304210-01-26-24-cn-op-chart-768x327.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706304210-01-26-24-cn-op-chart-1536x653.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706304210-01-26-24-cn-op-chart-150x64.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1790px) 100vw, 1790px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-157540" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Source: TradingView / <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/OPUSDT/?exchange=BINANCE">OPUSDT</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <strong>OP price</strong> appears to be gaining positive momentum after finding support around the key Fib 0.618 level of $2.889. This comes after a steep 39.05% retracement between January 12 and January 23. With three consecutive days of gains so far, the OP price looks to take on nearby resistance to continue the recovery.</p>
<p>Looking at technical indicators, the OP price has room for further upside. The RSI has climbed to 45.11 from yesterday&#8217;s 41.99 reading, showing growing bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram has become less negative at -0.089, up from -0.109 the previous day.</p>
<p>As the OP price pushes further above $3, it faces immediate resistance at the 50-day EMA of $3.029 followed by the horizontal resistance zone of $3.094 to $3.170 which is also in confluence with the Fib 0.5 level of $3.136. Clearing these levels could open the door for a move toward the 20-day EMA of $3.217.</p>
<p>On the downside, initial support lies at the horizontal zone between $2.793 and $2.887 which aligns with the Fib 0.618 level of $2.889. This area has held up well on recent declines.</p>
<p>With the OP price breaking its short-term downtrend, bullish momentum seems to be building. Sustained trading above the $3.136 resistance would confirm the emerging uptrend. Conservative traders may prefer to wait for a pullback towards $2.889 support before entering new bullish positions.</p>
<p>Major cryptocurrencies aren&#8217;t the only ones making moves &#8211; <strong>fresh crypto players</strong> are also vying for attention. Bitcoin Minetrix and Meme Kombat have used tactics like giveaways and gameplay to drive presale interest as their public launches approach.</p>
<h2><strong>The Best Crypto to Buy Now: Exploring Promising Bitcoin Alternatives</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
With Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance as the pioneering cryptocurrency, it&#8217;s easy to focus solely on it when exploring the cryptocurrency domain. However, limiting your crypto portfolio to Bitcoin alone means missing out on the huge potential of <strong>up-and-coming Bitcoin alternatives</strong> looking to make their mark.</p>
<p>Getting in early on presale events for new cryptocurrencies gives investors the chance to buy tokens at reduced prices before they become publicly available. Bitcoin alternatives like Bitcoin Minetrix and Meme Kombat have seen considerable presale interest from investors attracted to the prospects of major returns if these projects gain momentum post-launch.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Two Hidden Meme Coin GEMS (Next 10x Crypto?!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3mU6oqoNvM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Presales for cryptocurrencies typically provide incentives like discounted token prices, bonus token allotments, and exclusive prize contests to entice early participants.</p>
<p>For example, Bitcoin Minetrix is organizing a <strong>$30,000 giveaway</strong> with prizes shared between 10 winners who will get $3,000 in <strong>BTCMTX tokens</strong> each &#8211; amassing over 40,000 participants to date with 157 days left. Ventures like this highlight the inventive tactics some new cryptocurrencies employ to create excitement during their presale stage.</p>
<p>For crypto enthusiasts, doing thorough research and keeping a <strong>diverse investment portfolio</strong> is critical to successfully maneuver the constantly changing cryptocurrency market with opportunities. This is especially important when evaluating the best crypto to buy now and considering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-future-cryptocurrency-projects.htm">other Bitcoin alternatives striving to redefine finance</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Bitcoin Minetrix Makes Bitcoin Cloud Mining Accessible &#8211; Is It the Best Crypto to Buy Now?</strong></h3>
<p>A new cryptocurrency project called Bitcoin Minetrix has raised over $9.5 million in a presale, leading some in the industry to draw comparisons with <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s early days</strong>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Minetrix seeks to make Bitcoin mining accessible to regular crypto users through an <strong>Ethereum-based cloud mining platform</strong> that requires no expensive hardware or technical expertise.</p>
<p>The ongoing presale allows early investors to purchase the $BTCMTX token for $0.0131, with the price set to incrementally rise as the sale continues. Presale participants can stake their tokens to compound returns before the upcoming public launch.</p>

<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) anticipates substantial increases in energy consumption from crypto mining and artificial intelligence (AI) in the coming years, with projections suggesting a more than 30% surge by 2026.</p>
<p>The IEA&#8217;s <em>Electricity 2024</em> <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ddd078a8-422b-44a9-a668-52355f24133b/Electricity2024-Analysisandforecastto2026.pdf">report</a> outlines the expected growth in energy usage through 2026, highlighting that power generation, including for crypto mining purposes, remains a major contributor to carbon emissions but is leading the transition to net-zero emissions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, renewables are forecasted to become the primary sources of power by 2025, according to the report.</p>
<p>The report noted that energy consumption by data centers, AI, and crypto mining facilities may surpass 1,000 terawatt-hours (TWh), more than doubling in the specified timeframe.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Data centres are now the main drivers of electricity demand growth in many regions</p>
<p>And electricity consumption from the sector — along with AI &amp; cryptocurrency — could double by 2026</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Crypto mining predicted to use as much electricity as Japan</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In terms of AI specifically, the report said the growing sector is set to experience a tenfold increase in power consumption between 2023 and 2026, with large language models (LLMs) like <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/could-chatgpts-latest-enhancement-herald-revolutionary-phase-for-crypto.htm">ChatGPT</a> alone expected to consume nearly 10 TWh per year.</p>
<p>The rise in energy usage from crypto and related activities is projected to reach the level of Japan&#8217;s electricity consumption.</p>
<p>In 2023, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-sites.htm">Bitcoin mining</a> alone consumed 120 TWh, up from 110 TWh in 2022.</p>
<p>Despite the report acknowledging that crypto mining constitutes a small portion of global energy consumption, it did raise concerns about challenges in reducing electricity consumption.</p>
<p>The IEA predicts that crypto mining will consume 160 TWh by 2026.</p>

<h2>Commander turned director</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>Known for his role as Commander William Riker in Star Trek, Frakes has a bevy of directing titles under his belt, including </span><i><span>Burn Notice</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Roswell</span></i><span>, and two </span><i><span>Star Trek</span></i><span> films. Garzik, who previously worked as a<a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-history/"> prominent developer of Bitcoin</a> Core and, opened NextCypher in 2022.</span><span>&ldquo;I launched NextCypher to capitalize on the appetite for innovative, high-quality genre entertainment,&rdquo; Garzik </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/01/jonathan-frakes-deathlands-jeff-garzik-tv-adaptation-1235803252/"><span>told Deadline</span></a><span>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see the market aligning with our vision of producing smartly budgeted, and exceptional content for a global audience.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h2>&#8220;Hope, romance, and resilience in the face of adversity&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>Originally published in 1986, </span><i><span>Deathlands</span></i><span> takes place in a post-apoclyptic world and follows a group of survivors who must band together as they utilize telportation techynology to traverse their unforgiving landscape.</span><span>&ldquo;With a series that is gritty, suspenseful, and action-packed, with a sense of hope, romance, and resilience in the face of adversity, I cannot imagine anyone better to bring </span><i><span>Deathlands </span></i><span>to the screen than visionary director, Jonathan Frakes,&rdquo; Altman told Deadline.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be more thrilled to have him onboard to ensure the series will be appointment television for viewers everywhere.&rdquo;</span><span>Currently, shooting is scheduled for this spring in Bulgaria. Garzik is serving alongside Thomas P. Vitale as executive producer, with Mark A. Altman as both showrunner and executive producer. International sales are being Tai Truesdell and Bertrand Reignier of Rogue Wave Entertainment, with casting by Christine Sheaks.</span><span>&ldquo;One of the things that I find so compelling about </span><i><span>Deathlands</span></i><span> is that it&rsquo;s a series about hope and the chance to build a better world,&rdquo; Frakes told Deadline. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited about the opportunity to bring this show, combining feature-level action and compelling character drama, to the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>There&#8217;s more action-packed series to come from Garzik</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>Yet, Deathlands is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-report-highlights-resurgence-in-defi-and-nft-sectors.htm">just the tip of the iceberg</a> for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-web3.htm">Web3 production studio</a>.&nbsp;</span><span>NextCypher is also developing another sci-fi series about a woman who loses her memory on a quest to &ldquo;save the outcasts of society from a deadly conspiracy that threatens to destroy the future.&rdquo;</span><span>&ldquo;</span><i><span>Deathlands</span></i><span> is an ideal launchpad for us, especially considering the success of similar post-apocalyptic series based on successful IPs like </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span> and the eagerly anticipated </span><i><span>Fallout,&rdquo; </span></i><span>Garzik said.</span><span>A release date is yet to be announced.</span><br style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, <a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> has recently reversed its downward trend, surpassing the significant $41,000 mark. This resurgence not only bolsters confidence in Bitcoin but also paves the way for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>, Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/Litecoin/">Litecoin (LTC)</a>, all of which have witnessed modest gains.</p>
<p>The overall <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/">crypto market cap</a> now stands at an impressive $1.56 trillion, marking over 0.30% increase in the last 24 hours. This positive momentum in the crypto world is partly attributed to the burgeoning interest in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-etfs.htm">Bitcoin ETFs</a>, a development that underscores the cryptocurrency&#8217;s growing acceptance in mainstream finance.</p>
<p>Concurrently, Tesla&#8217;s unwavering hold on $380 million worth of Bitcoin through Q4 2023 plays a critical role in shaping market sentiment, while the SEC&#8217;s postponement of Grayscale and BlackRock&#8217;s Ethereum ETFs introduces a layer of uncertainty in the ETH market.</p>
<h2>Tesla&#8217;s Q4 2023 Bitcoin Holdings: Influence on BTC Prices</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In Q4 2023, <a href="https://usethebitcoin.com/teslas-q4-2023-earnings-reveal-steady-bitcoin-holdings/">Tesla&#8217;s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings remained steady</a>, as indicated in their recent earnings report released on Wednesday. The report didn&#8217;t mention any Bitcoin transactions, suggesting no buying or selling during the quarter.</p>
<p>Currently valued at $387 million, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-2.htm">Tesla owns approximately 9,720 BTC</a>, ranking as the third-largest public holder after MicroStrategy and Marathon. Tesla initially invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in February 2021, acquiring around 43,000 BTC.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite selling 75% of their holdings in Q2 2022 amid COVID uncertainties, the electric car giant continues to maintain a substantial Bitcoin reserve.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a> holdings of Elon Musk&#39;s Tesla, worth nearly $387 million at current prices, remained unchanged in Q4 2023.<a href="https://t.co/lPfhWkK8jj">https://t.co/lPfhWkK8jj</a></p>
<p>&mdash; David odeyale (@odeyale_david) <a href="https://twitter.com/odeyale_david/status/1750687877644566850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Therefore, Tesla maintaining its Bitcoin holdings in Q4 2023 signals stability, impacting BTC price sentiment positively. With Tesla holding a significant amount, investor confidence in Bitcoin could strengthen, potentially contributing to sustained or increased value.</p>
<h2>SEC Postpones Grayscale, BlackRock Ethereum ETFs: ETH Market Impact</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sec-delays-decision-grayscale-blackrocks-spot-ethereum-etfs-2024-01-25/">postponed</a> a decision on Grayscale Investments&#8217; request to convert its Ethereum trust product (ETHE) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
<p>However, BlackRock&#8217;s similar application also faced a delay. The SEC has been cautious about spot crypto ETFs, recently allowing only spot bitcoin ETFs in January. Therefore, the delay in deciding on Grayscale and BlackRock&#8217;s applications is not unexpected.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In no surprise, the <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SECgov</a> has delayed decisions on spot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/etherETF?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#etherETF</a> applications from Grayscale and BlackRock.<a href="https://t.co/hLt54lbv7m">https://t.co/hLt54lbv7m</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1750709597080350851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The filings raise questions about the similarities between spot Ethereum and spot bitcoin ETFs, addressing concerns like market manipulation and the size of the CME futures market. So, this echoes the SEC&#8217;s previous inquiries about bitcoin.</p>
<p>Consequently, the SEC&#8217;s delay in approving spot ether ETFs from Grayscale and BlackRock has introduced uncertainty, potentially impacting Ethereum&#8217;s price. Market participants keenly await regulatory decisions, as approval could positively influence ETH&#8217;s value, while continued delays may introduce volatility.</p>

<p>The latest chart for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) showcases a decisive break from its previous downtrend, marked by a bullish breakout past the critical $40,150 threshold. This movement is reinforced by the formation of bullish engulfing candles, suggesting a strong upward momentum.</p>
<p>The pivot point at this juncture is defined by the green line, situated at $40,957, serving as a fulcrum for price action.</p>

<p>On the downside, Bitcoin has immediate support at $38,618. Should this level be breached, Looking above this pivot, we identify three resistance levels at $41,927, $43,394, and $45,581, delineated by blue lines, which could pose successive hurdles for the ascent.</p>
<p>Conversely, the red lines below the pivot point indicate support levels at $39,998, $39,644, and $38,618, which may offer a foundation for price stabilization in the event of a pullback.</p>

<p>The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) hovers at $2,237.1, providing a dynamic level of potential support.</p>
<p>Current price stability near the pivot point suggests a tussle between bulls and bears, with a breakout above or below this zone likely to dictate the short-term trend.</p>

<p>A new platform named BitcoinOS aimed at bringing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/should-i-buy-bitcoin.htm">Bitcoin</a> into the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape has been introduced by a team of blockchain developers at Sovryn.</p>
<p>The platform, which the developers describe as an “operating system” for Bitcoin, utilizes &#8220;sovryn rollups,&#8221; creating a foundational layer for decentralized applications (dapps) on the Bitcoin network, according to an <a href="https://sovryn.com/all-things-sovryn/bitcoinos-building-in-layers-to-unlock-bitcoins-potential">announcement</a> posted on Sovryn’s website this week.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Does Bitcoin seem frozen in time? Other chains have smart contracts, scaling layers, rollups &#8211; and Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Introducing BitcoinOS: a superlayer of interoperable rollups turning Bitcoin into a global operating system.</p>
<p>Innovation is coming to Bitcoin!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinOS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BitcoinOS</a></p>

<p>&mdash; Sovryn | DeFi for Bitcoin (@SovrynBTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/SovrynBTC/status/1750534568157872152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This platform, presented as a &#8220;public good,&#8221; allows any developer to contribute and build tools in their preferred programming language.</p>
<p>BitcoinOS will be “be game-changing,” the announcement on Sovryn’s website proclaimed, noting that it combines “rollup flexibility and scalability, ensuring interoperability, and allowing seamless movement of Bitcoin and native assets across systems.”</p>
<p>“BitcoinOS redefines Bitcoin as a global operating system for the world,” the announcement added.</p>
<h2>BitcoinOS increases speed and lower costs of transactions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin&#8217;s primary blockchain, recognized for its high security, has over the years been criticized by some members of the crypto community for its slower transaction speed and higher costs during peak periods.</p>
<p>BitcoinOS aims to address these limitations by providing scalability, programmability, interoperability, and a nearly trustless security model.</p>
<p>The platform&#8217;s fraud system enables even a single honest participant to prevent fraudulent transactions, thereby enhancing security.</p>
<p>Sovryn’s announcement also highlighted that BitcoinOS allows for complete smart contracts, enabling developers to launch their rollups, fostering composability and interoperability among various applications.</p>
<p>The project thus seeks to prevent liquidity silos and enable shared economic activity between different projects, the announcement said.</p>
<p>Sovryn is also known as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sovryn-introduces-decentralized-bitcoin-backed-sovryn-dollar-to-combat-centralized-stablecoins.htm">issuer of the Sovryn Dollar (DLLR)</a>, a Bitcoin-backed decentralized stablecoin which is redeemable for BTC.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vm82s9c77q8kdodprluyj/Ripple-Request-to-File-Sur-Reply.pdf?rlkey=fdbl1za8pyzz89blne6edc9ei&amp;dl=0">court filing</a> addressed to Judge Netburn, Ripple&#8217;s legal representatives highlighted the relevance of the sur-reply, emphasizing its role in rectifying a significant factual mischaracterization made by the US securities agency in its initial reply.</p>
<p>The Ripple team stated that the sur-reply is vital in clarifying these misconceptions, thereby allowing the courts to rule on accurate records.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the defendant&rsquo;s legal team challenged the SEC&#8217;s statement that Ripple &#8220;does not &hellip; argue that it would be burdened in producing&rdquo; post-compliant institutional sales contracts.</p>
<p>The defendant deemed this claim false, having earlier expressed that the process would be &ldquo;overly burdensome&rdquo; following the agency&rsquo;s previous request.</p>
<p>Ripple also zoned in on another SEC statement claiming that it had cataloged and presumably produced all of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-judge-says-ripple-sales-of-xrp-not-investment-contract-can-xrp-reach-100.htm">XRP sales contracts</a> from 2020 to June 2023, including identifying the recipients.</p>
<p>According to the defendant, this claim is also false, and its sur-reply is geared towards showing that the blockchain network has not sanctioned any sales of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-xrp/">XRP</a> contracts during the period of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Additionally, the cross-border decentralized solution pointed out that the SEC had requested records surrounding &ldquo;ODL&rdquo; contracts even though no sales contracts were issued after December 22, 2020, soon after the lawsuit began.</p>
<p>These sales contracts are said to cover vendors, consultants, independent contractors, grants, donations, and other distributions the court had previously stated are not sales of investment contracts.</p>
<p>Ripple has implored the courts to disregard the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;misstatement of facts&rdquo; even as the lawsuit proceeds.
</p>
<h2>Three-Year Legal Dance Continues</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
The Ripple blockchain, launched in 2012, is a new generation of decentralized value transmission systems.</p>
<p>Rather than disrupting the current fiat-backed financial system, Ripple aims to improve it by offering lower costs for value transfer and faster transaction resolution across borders. This mission has since led to the protocol being dubbed the cross-border network.</p>
<p>However, the protocol came into the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-slides-to-two-month-low-as-sec-filed-suit-against-ripp-8703.htm">cross-hairs of the SEC</a> after former boss Jay Clayton began legal lawsuits against both the blockchain and its founder, Chris Larsen, and CEO, Brad Garlinghouse.</p>
<p>According to the SEC, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-blockchain.htm">blockchain network</a> was involved in selling crypto-backed securities through its XRP asset as it passed the &lsquo;Howey Test.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the defendants have maintained their innocence and required the SEC&rsquo;s opinion on what it categorizes Bitcoin and Ethereum projects.</p>
<p>While the case is still ongoing, the popular Coinbase exchange is also in a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arguments-conclude-in-coinbase-and-sec-case-judge-failla-holds-on-decision.htm">legal battle</a> with the premier securities agency on the definition surrounding the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-vs-sec-regulator-pushes-back-against-exchange.htm">Howey Test</a>.</p>
<p>In a recent post on X by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the crypto exchange and the SEC engaged in a five-hour standoff where they argued their positions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Coinbase vs SEC Court Hearing LIVE<a href="https://t.co/BkM0TBOkqt">https://t.co/BkM0TBOkqt</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The SEC had sued Coinbase for offering <a href="https://x.com/MetaLawMan/status/1747670652708933731?s=20">unregistered securities</a> on its platform and argued that the defendant was out to create their own version of the Howey Test to legalize their actions.</p>

<p>The crypto market experienced whiplash this week, with Bitcoin and related crypto stocks seeing a sharp selloff followed by a big rebound. After falling below $39,000 early in the week, bitcoin popped back above $42,000 on Friday, lifting crypto-focused stocks with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-sites.htm">Bitcoin mining companies</a> saw the biggest gains, with the likes of <strong>Core Scientific</strong>, <strong>Hut 8</strong>, and <strong>TeraWulf</strong> jumping 15% or more. Other crypto stocks like <strong>Coinbase</strong> and <strong>MicroStrategy</strong>, which hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet, also rallied 3-5%.</p>
<p>The initial catalyst for the selloff was profit-taking after the long-awaited Bitcoin ETF approval, which some saw as a &#8220;sell the news&#8221; event. Outflows from the <strong>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust</strong> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/just-in-ftxs-bankruptcy-estate-sold-22-million-gbtc-shares-leading-to-1-billion-gbtc-outflow.htm">selling pressure from FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy estate</a> added fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>Some analysts view the weakness as temporary, however. 10x Research head of research <a href="https://twitter.com/thielen10x">Markus Thielen</a> believes macro tailwinds will support Bitcoin through 2024. He sees the <strong>U.S. election cycle</strong> prompting constructive fiscal policy that lifts asset prices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if Bitcoin ETF inflows disappoint, this is not the time to turn bearish as the macro environment will remain a tailwind in 2024, and the US election cycle will see a constructive fiscal response that will lift asset prices higher,&#8221; Thielen noted.</p>

<h2>Feast or Famine for Coinbase After Extreme Week</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It was a week of extremes for crypto exchange Coinbase, with wild share price swings after both an upgrade and downgrade from Wall Street in rapid succession.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-analysts-downgrade-coinbase-shares-to-underweight-citing-impact-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">JPMorgan slapped Coinbase with an underweight rating</a> due to disappointing flows into Bitcoin ETFs. This added pressure to an already brutal selloff, pushing Coinbase stock down nearly 10% intraday Tuesday.</p>
<p>But sentiment shifted Thursday after analysts from <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-upgraded-oppenheimer-crypto-exchange-160107023.html">Oppenheimer upgraded Coinbase</a>, citing the exchange&#8217;s strong fundamentals and battle-tested management team. The upgrade helped drive Coinbase shares up 7% Thursday.</p>
<p>Such volatility is par for the course when it comes to crypto stocks. With Coinbase heavily exposed to crypto price action, analysts warn investors should brace for continued turbulence ahead.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Proxy Stock Mirrors Crypto&#8217;s Ups and Downs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
MicroStrategy, which holds billions in Bitcoin on its corporate balance sheet, trades in lockstep with the crypto as a de facto BTC proxy stock.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">MicroStrategy is buying.<br />BlackRock is buying<br />El Salvador is buying<br />Ark is buying<br />billion dollar companies are buying.</p>
<p>And you&#39;re still selling</p>
<p>This will be one of the biggest bullrun in crypto history. In whatever you’re buying make sure you add <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ARC</a> in the bag. Huge AI season</p>
<p>&mdash; Kency₿ (@KencyXBT) <a href="https://twitter.com/KencyXBT/status/1750930435369058360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This week was no exception, with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/mstr">MicroStrategy shares</a> rising and falling in tandem with Bitcoin&#8217;s wild price swings. The stock shed nearly 15% during Bitcoin&#8217;s plunge below $39,000, then rebounded around 8% as BTC popped back above $42,000.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy&#8217;s latest Bitcoin buying spree came in late 2023—between November 30 and December 26—when <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/microstrategy-buys-bitcoin-worth-6157-mln-ahead-secs-spot-etf-decision-2023-12-27/#:~:text=Dec%2027%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Software,exchange%20traded%20fund%20(ETF).">the company scooped up about 14,620 more coins</a> to grow its holdings to around 189,000 BTC.</p>
<p>With such a large crypto position relative to its market cap, MicroStrategy will likely continue to be affected by Bitcoin&#8217;s frequent booms and busts.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto developers just dropped a new tool that lets creators monetize their content with Bitcoin (BTC) – and it&#8217;s a lot more flexible than fiat-based competitors.</p>
<p>Built by programmers Pierre Corbin and Hugo Ferrer, Bitcoin payment gateway “<a href="https://paywithflash.com/">Flash</a>” brings subscriptions, paywalls, and payment links to the digital currency’s native peer-to-peer economy. Aspiring BTC merchants can set up the tool in a minute, and start getting paid in seconds over the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-successfully-integrates-bitcoin-lightning-network-for-faster-cheaper-transactions.htm">lightning network</a>.</p>
<p>“We want to make it the easiest platform to earn in Bitcoin, but also to use Bitcoin in general,” Corbin told <em>Cryptonews</em> via DM. “Today, with a Flash account, you can already &#8220;Pay with Flash&#8221; on our solutions from any device.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Announcing Flash!</p>
<p>For months, <a href="https://twitter.com/HugoFerrer_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HugoFerrer_</a> and I have been experimenting with building AI tools, implementing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nostr?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Nostr</a> and lightning transactions.</p>
<p>And I think we&#39;ve come up with a few innovations.<a href="https://twitter.com/paywflash?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@paywflash</a> is a new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bitcoin</a> payment gateway with a lot of great tools</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/klly8W4po7">https://t.co/klly8W4po7</a> <a href="https://t.co/un4uOEorcv">pic.twitter.com/un4uOEorcv</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Pierre Corbin (@CierrePorbin) <a href="https://twitter.com/CierrePorbin/status/1750193999854346467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Flash differentiates itself by leveraging the nostr protocol – short for &#8220;notes and other stuff transmitted by relays” – and its brand new open-source P2P payment technology called Nostr Wallet Connect.</p>
<p>The protocol is typically advertised as a decentralized social media network, and is a favorite of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and other prominent Bitcoiners. But given its direct compatibility with the lightning network, Corbin saw it as a perfect user-management system shared between applications that could be used to integrate payments into any app.</p>
<p>As such, any user who onboards Flash will automatically be on nostr, and applications integrating Flash for subscriptions will receive the user’s nostr information: username, about me, profile picture, and public key.</p>
<p>Corbin explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To get set, all a user needs to do is fill in a form, they get an html snippet &lt;script&gt; that can be added to any page, and the product is live, including login and logout buttons, and user information (including subscription plan, payment status, etc).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin Beyond Subscriptions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Alternatively, Flash’s one-time users interacting with its paywalls and payment links can pay using one of four popular lightning wallet options</p>
<p>Flash also includes a first-of-its-kind product called the “video paywall.” Rather than pay to watch videos by the second (ex. a ten-minute portion of a movie) rather than buying the entire video if you don’t plan to watch it.</p>
<p>Users can view their Bitcoin balances and make transactions on Flash, but the platform’s managers never have access to their BTC, instead relying on the lightning network’s existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>“We serve as a software communication service between these wallets, also making us the first true lightning payment gateway (as opposed to processor),” Corbin said.</p>

<p>Investors are fretting over whether Bitcoin might be going to zero, as digital asset management firm Grayscale continues to dump BTC on the market from its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) ETF.</p>
<p>Just on Friday, Grayscale sent another $400 million worth of BTC to Coinbase to be sold, crypto analyst @CryptoTony__ reported.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot; Grayscale sent 10,000 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BTC</a>  worth $400m to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Coinbase?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Coinbase</a> &quot;</p>

<p>&mdash; Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoTony__/status/1750569217932378366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>He questioned whether Bitcoin is going to a price of zero.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-spot-etfs-witness-highest-single-day-outflows-as-gbtc-continues-to-bleed.htm">Grayscale has been dumping Bitcoin</a> from its GBTC fund following the fund’s conversion to a spot ETF this month.</p>
<p>That reflects investors dumping their GBTC holdings.</p>
<p>Investors have been selling GBTC for two main reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, many savvy traders bought up a lot of GBTC in 2023 before it was an ETF, and when it was trading at a discount to net asset value.</p>
<p>That essentially meant they got their Bitcoin (in the form of GBTC shares) on sale.</p>
<p>Now that they can redeem GBTC 1:1 for Bitcoin or its cash equivalent, their trade is “won”.</p>
<p>They are now taking profit, and dumping their GBTC holdings.</p>
<p>Others are dumping GBTC because of its high management fee compared to other newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, like BlackRocks.</p>
<p>Many investors might also be dumping GBTC because they viewed recent <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-was-a-sell-the-news-event-cryptoquant.htm">spot ETF approvals as a “sell-the-news” event</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Bitcoin Isn’t Going to Zero</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Grayscale sell pressure has been a significant factor driving prices lower since spot ETF approvals.</p>
<p>A recent Deutsche Bank survey suggested many retail investors think it will drop back under $20,000.</p>
<p>42% of survey participants said they “anticipate Bitcoin’s disappearance” eventually.</p>
<p>But the likelihood of Bitcoin going to zero is very slim.</p>
<p>For Bitcoin to go to zero, people need to stop using its network and wanting to buy it.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/dashboards/btc-core-on-chain">Glassnode data</a> shows network activity continues to trend higher, suggesting increased adoption.</p>
<p>And strong demand for newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, such as from BlackRocks, suggests many investors still want Bitcoin in their portfolio.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-new-bitcoin-etf-secures-25k-btc-holdings-is-institutional-fomo-underway.htm">BlackRock’s iShare Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)</a> already has over $2 billion in assets under management.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s global notoriety continues to rise.</p>
<p>People are more and more buying into the idea that it is a form of digital gold.</p>
<p>People are also more and more understanding Bitcoin’s crucial decentralized characteristics that make it the perfect bulwark against corrupt, incompetent and authoritarian governments.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is decentralized, censorship-resistant, permissionless and borderless.</p>
<p>The approval of new spot ETFs in the US presents a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-btc-etf-approval-will-encourage-more-institutions-to-invest-in-bitcoin-cathie-wood.htm">new demand shock</a> just as the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm">growth rate of BTC supply is about half</a>, delivering a supply shock.</p>
<p>Rate cuts from central banks this year are also expected to act as a headwind for the BTC, as liquidity conditions improve.</p>
<p>A much more likely scenario than Bitcoin going to zero this year is new all-time highs above $69,000.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bitcoin offer’s big potential returns but investors should never want to put all their eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>For those looking to diversify, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Indeed, one such project called Meme Kombat, which also secured praise from @CryptoTony__ last year, is amongst their favored presales.</p>

<p>A new sustainable cryptocurrency project focused on <strong>eco-friendly transportation</strong> solutions is generating impressive traction in its presale. The startup, called eTuktuk, has raised over $550,000 to date from investors buying the project&#8217;s native token TUK.</p>
<p>As a green crypto project focused on improving urban transportation sustainability, eTuktuk offers a unique value proposition. The project wants to transition <a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/assets/users/kirchstetter/Apte%20et%20al%2C%20Particles%20in%20Auto-Rickshaw%20Exhaust%2C%20Atm%20Env%202011.pdf">auto rickshaws in developing countries</a> from polluting gas engines to electric vehicles and reduce the <strong>carbon footprint</strong> of these vehicles locally dubbed &#8220;tuk-tuks&#8221;.</p>
<p>Beyond manufacturing electric tuk-tuks, eTuktuk will incorporate <strong>blockchain technology</strong> for security, efficiency, and scalability, while providing <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/the-holy-grail-of-digital-identity-is-not-entirely-sovereign-1816.htm">digital identities</a> and financial services to disadvantaged communities relying on tuk-tuks.</p>

<h2>Sustainable Cryptocurrency Provides Entry Opportunity for Investors</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While TUK will enable payments and transactions within the eTuktuk ecosystem, holders can also earn staking rewards up to 300% APY by locking their tokens, giving TUK intrinsic value.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As more electric tuk-tuks get deployed and people adopt the eTuktuk platform, the utility and demand for TUK should increase. This potential for wider usage and profit through staking is driving the presale momentum.</p>
<p>With the presale almost reaching its $680,000 goal already, the current stage is likely to conclude soon. The next phase will increase the TUK price from the current $0.026.</p>
<p>The presale traction provides a look into eTuktuk&#8217;s future potential, especially given its environmental focus and real-world transportation use case. Investors may consider entering at the current presale price to potentially maximize long-term returns.</p>
<h2>How to Buy eTukTuk Tokens</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Purchasing eTukTuk&#8217;s $TUK tokens is straightforward during the current presale phase. Follow these steps to acquire $TUK for your crypto wallet:</p>
<h3>Step 1: Set Up A Compatible Wallet</h3>
<p>First, you&#8217;ll need a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-crypto-wallets.htm">cryptocurrency wallet</a> that supports Ethereum-based tokens like $TUK. Popular options include <strong>MetaMask</strong>, <strong>Trust Wallet</strong>, and <strong>Wallet Connect</strong>.</p>
<p>Desktop users can download the wallet&#8217;s browser extension, while mobile users can install the app on their devices. Then create a new wallet account.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Fund Your Wallet</h3>
<p>To buy $TUK, your wallet will need to be funded with ETH, BNB, or USDT. You can purchase these major cryptocurrencies on any <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/top-10-crypto-exchanges-saw-34-26-trillion-trading-volume-in-2023.htm">leading exchange</a> if you don&#8217;t already own them. Once purchased, transfer the funds to your compatible wallet.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Connect Your Wallet</h3>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk">eTukTuk presale website</a>, click &#8220;Connect Wallet&#8221; and choose your wallet. Follow the prompts to connect it to the eTukTuk presale site.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Cardano (ADA) price is rebounding on Friday after hitting multi-month lows earlier in the week under $0.45.</p>
<p>The rebound mostly reflects an upturn in prices across the broader crypto market.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) was up more than 5% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>The Cardano price was last up by a similar margin.</p>
<p>The rebound in the Cardano price could also reflect strength in an important metric of the Cardano blockchain’s adoption.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/p_a6behjl6oc">Cardano Blockchain Insights</a>, the number of smart contracts issued on the blockchain has jumped by more than 10,000 this month.</p>
<p>Decentralized applications built on blockchains rely on smart contracts.</p>
<p>The jump in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/">Cardano</a> smart contract deployment is thus indicative of accelerating dApp building activity.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/cardano/">Cardano</a> price’s latest rebound confirms that the 100DMA remains a strong area of support.</p>
<p>But price predictions are unlikely to turn substantially bullish until ADA is able to get back above its 21DMA at $0.516.</p>
<h2><strong>Cardano Price Prediction – Can ADA Overtake Solana?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For Cardano price predictions to turn bullish, ADA will also likely need to push above its recent short-term downtrend.</p>
<p>If it can manage that, a retest of recent highs in the $0.67 area is a strong possibility.</p>
<figure id="attachment_157503" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157503" style="width: 1781px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-157503" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada.png" alt="Cardano (ADA) Price Chart / Source: TradingView" width="1781" height="708" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada.png 1781w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada-300x119.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada-1024x407.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada-768x305.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada-1536x611.png 1536w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706295230-ada-150x60.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1781px) 100vw, 1781px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-157503" class="wp-caption-text">Cardano (ADA) Price Chart / Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>While Cardano stands a good chance of rallying back to yearly highs, it will be tougher to overtake Solana.</p>
<p>At roughly $40 billion, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">Solana’s market capitalization</a> is well over double Cardano’s, which was last around $17 billion.</p>
<p>And a quick look at the respective cryptocurrency ecosystems suggests that the difference in valuation is warranted.</p>
<p>As per DeFi Llama, <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana">Solana</a> has a TVL of nearly $4.5 billion, over 10 times <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano">Cardano’s</a>.</p>
<p>Solana has a stablecoin market cap or nearly $2 billion, also 10 times that on Cardano.</p>
<p>DEX volumes on Solana were over $550 million in the past 24 hours to Cardano’s less than $7 million.</p>
<p>All said the Cardano blockchain will need to see a big increase in use and adoption to stand a chance of overtaking Solana’s valuation.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Cardano offers big potential returns but comes with a lot of risk given its lack of adoption.</p>
<p>For those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Estonian government has decided to renew the United States extradition of two alleged fraudsters accused of running a $575 million scheme, Estonian Public Broadcasting reports.</p>
<h2>“Justified in accordance with the rule of law”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The extradition’s approval <a href="https://news.err.ee/1609232742/estonian-government-renews-decision-to-extradite-crypto-traders-to-us">reverses an earlier decision</a> made by the Tallinn Circuit Court in November to block the extradition, citing “procedural irregularities” and “conditions of detention in the United States.”</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/estonian-crypto-firms-engage-in-massive-scale-fraud-and-aid-russia-evade-sanctions-report.htm">Estonian</a> Minister of Justice Kent Lalle stated the court “verified” that the conditions of the accused perpetrators&#8217; upcoming detention facility in the U.S. were “humane” and “lawful.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The government concluded that the extradition of the citizens to the U.S. is justified in accordance with the rule of law and does not disproportionately affect the rights of the citizens,” Lalle said.</p>
<h2>A half-a-billion-dollar global crypto scheme</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
News of the extradition comes just over a year after Estonian citizens Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turõgin were arrested for orchestrating the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/two-estonian-citizens-arrested-575-million-cryptocurrency-fraud-and-money-laundering">more than half-billion dollar fraud</a>. U.S. prosecutors allege the duo lured victims to invest in crypto mining firm, Hashflare, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-cryptocurrency/">digital asset</a> bank, Polybius Bank, before laundering funds into shell companies in order to “purchase real estate and luxury cars.”</p>
<p>“The size and scope of the alleged scheme is truly astounding,” U.S. Attorney Nick Brown of the Western District of Washington stated in a November 2022 press release.</p>
<p>“They lured investors with false representations and then paid early investors off with money from those who invested later,” Brown continued.</p>
<p>“They tried to hide their ill-gotten gain in Estonian properties, luxury cars, bank accounts, and virtual currency wallets around the world.”</p>
<h2>Facing a lengthy prison sentence following extradition</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
U.S. Attorneys allege that Hashflare itself was a sham, performing “<a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-bitcoin/">Bitcoin mining</a> at a rate of less than one percent of the computing power it purported to have.”</p>
<p>Moreover, it was found that Polybius Bank was never established, as Potapenko and Turõgin pocketed the $25 million they had raised for its creation.</p>
<p>“The indictment alleges that the money laundering conspiracy involved at least 75 real properties, six luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency wallets, and thousands of cryptocurrency mining machines,” reads the November 2022 press release.</p>
<p>Potapenko and Turõgin are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and 16 counts of wire fraud.</p>
<p>“Each of these crimes is punishable by up to 20 years in prison,” continues the</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney’s press release.It is currently unclear what detention facility Potapenko and Turõgin will be extradited to.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Algorand Foundation reported that its CEO Staci Warden&#8217;s X account was compromised, leading to unauthorized posts on the account. The compromised account posted offensive content, including derogatory language and false statements about the Algorand community.</p>
<p>CEO Staci Warden X&#8217;s (formerly Twitter) account was compromised, and the hacker posted derogatory <a href="https://twitter.com/StaciW_DC/status/1750730960977465661">comments</a> about the Algorand community using a racial slur. The hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/StaciW_DC/status/1750739599310062024">urged</a> the community to sell Algorand&#8217;s native token, ALGO, and buy Ether (ETH) instead.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/203c.png" alt="‼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/StaciW_DC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@StaciW_DC</a>’s account has been compromised.</p>
<p>Please do not click on any links on her account or respond to DMs.</p>
<p>We are in the process of recovering it.</p>
<p>&mdash; Algorand Foundation (@AlgoFoundation) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlgoFoundation/status/1750721213469794648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Additionally, the attacker posted satirical content about a fictional agreement with Tron founder Justin Sun, claiming that it gave Sun &#8220;total control&#8221; over Algorand and allowed him to mint any token back to True USD (TUSD). The hacker wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I accepted this offer immediately. Soon, Algorand will be pegged to VERY REAL USD, and a new era of digital commerce will commence.&#8221; The hacker also used satire to allege Sun&#8217;s projects will be responsible for the next &#8220;major financial collapse in crypto.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Algorand Foundation urged its community not to click on any links or respond to direct messages from Staci Warden&#8217;s compromised X account. Following the compromise of Staci Warden&#8217;s X account, the hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/StaciW_DC/status/1750754865490321742">continued</a> to post provocative content, including satirical stories and altered profile information. Some community members responded with amusement, while others took the opportunity to criticize Warden.</p>
<p>The hacker posted music on the compromised account, changed Warden&#8217;s profile bio, and alleged that the CEO had drained funds from the community while gaslighting them into thinking it was a hack. The profile bio was further modified to claim that Warden had exited the Algorand Foundation and taken up a new career as a &#8220;semi-professional pole dancer.&#8221;</p>
<h2><b>Hacker Compromises Algorand Foundation&#8217;s Twitter Account; the Community Reacts</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite the posts&#8217; unconventional and inappropriate nature, some community members appeared to find amusement in the hacker&#8217;s antics. An X user <a href="https://twitter.com/0xExcaliburp/status/1750760493399036289">suggested</a> that Algorand consider hiring the exploiter, while another proposed that the hacker be allowed to &#8220;keep the account.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, not everyone took the situation lightly. Some community members seized the opportunity to express criticism towards Warden. In response to the incident, ZachXBT, a well-known blockchain detective, commented that the hacker might make a better CEO for the Algorand Foundation.</p>
<p>Another X user took a jab at Warden&#8217;s qualifications, humorously <a href="https://twitter.com/greensellredbuy/status/1750767807548272926">suggesting</a> she might be suited for an intern position at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which also experienced a compromised X account earlier in January.</p>
<p>The hacker also published a post in which he promised to give away one Ethereum (ETH) for every percentage that the price of the ALGO token loses during this week.</p>
<p>In early January, unknown individuals <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/official-x-account-of-blockchain-security-firm-certik-compromised-whats-going-on.htm">hacked</a> the Twitter account of CertiK, a company specializing in security audits of smart contracts. A phishing link to a browser extension for protection against crypto scammers, Revoke.cash, appeared on the company&#8217;s page. However, the platform team quickly responded to the statement. The developers wrote about a possible hacking of the CertiK account.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/algo-algorand/">ALGO&#8217;s price</a> did not react with a significant drop following news of the hack. Over the past 24 hours, the token has fallen by 1.14% to $0.1606 at the time of writing. However, trading volumes dropped more significantly—by 7%—to $29.9 million.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin (BTC) price is enjoying an end-of-week relief rally in wake of economic data that showed inflationary pressures in the US continued to subside to more acceptable levels in December 2023.</p>
<p>US Core PCE Price Index figures showed YoY inflation falling to 2.9%, below the expected rate of 3.0%.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price was last probing $42,000, up over 5% in the past 24 hours as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-157467" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706290263-screenshot-2024-01-26-122449.png" alt="" width="957" height="563" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706290263-screenshot-2024-01-26-122449.png 957w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706290263-screenshot-2024-01-26-122449-300x176.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706290263-screenshot-2024-01-26-122449-768x452.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706290263-screenshot-2024-01-26-122449-150x88.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/view-mild-dec-us-pce-inflation-wont-divert-fed-easing-2024-2024-01-26/">Core PCE Price Index</a> is the US Federal Reserve’s favored measure of underlying price pressures in the USA.</p>
<p>With inflation in the US trending lower, this opens the door for rate cuts from the Fed this year.</p>
<p>Lower interest rates create a more favorable liquidity environment that can support crypto prices.</p>
<p>That could go some way in explaining why the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction.htm">Bitcoin</a> price has pushed higher since Friday’s US market open.</p>
<h2><strong>US Equity Market Rally, ETF Flows Pushing Bitcoin Price Higher?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As per the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html">CME’s Fed Watch tool</a>, US interest rate future market pricing implies a probability of just under 50% that the Fed starts cutting interest rates as soon as March, unchanged from one week ago.</p>
<p>That suggests that, in wake of the latest US inflation figures, macro traders aren’t substantially upping Fed rate cut bets.</p>
<p>That view is further substantiated by looking across traditional asset markets.</p>
<p>The US Dollar Index (DXY) is flat and relatively unchanged on the week in the mid-103s.</p>
<p>The US 10-year yield is flat and relatively unchanged on the week around 4.14%.</p>
<p>If the narrative in traditional asset markets was a build-up of Fed rate cut expectations, one would expect both to be falling.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price could be enjoying tailwinds from US stock prices.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 continues to press to fresh record levels and is now above 4,900.</p>
<p>Positive equity market risk appetite could be spilling over to crypto markets.</p>
<p>Grayscale sales of BTC from its GBTC ETF also appear to have slowed.</p>
<p>The last few days have seen <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/grayscale">Grayscale move 10,000 BTC per day</a> to be sold on exchanges.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, newly launched ETFs from the likes of BlackRock and other asset managers continue to attract substantial flows.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/who-has-the-best-bitcoin-etf-blackrocks-fee-still-a-mystery.htm">BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)</a> surpassed $2 billion in assets under management on Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jp-morgan-spot-bitcoin-etfs-could-see-25-billion-inflows-from-existing-products-without-fresh-capital.htm">JP Morgan</a> argued earlier in the week that sell pressure from Grayscale’s GBTC is “largely behind us” – traders had been buying GBTC throughout 2023 at a discount to net asset value (NAV) on the assumption that it would be converted to a spot ETF, and that GBTC shares would then be directly redeemable for Bitcoin at net asset value.</p>
<p>Traders had been taking profit on this successful trade on masse in wake of GBTC’s conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this month.</p>
<p>But JP Morgan thinks focus now switches to newly launched ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT.</p>
<p>Assuming flows into such funds remain strong, this could underpin the Bitcoin price going forward.</p>
<h2><strong>How High Can the BTC Go?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite the latest rebound, the Bitcoin price remains around 15% down from its recent highs above $49,000.</p>
<p>The latest bounce suggests the 100DMA and November highs around $38,000 both acted as strong support.</p>
<p>But the Bitcoin price may have problems breaking back above its 21 and 50DMAs near $43,000.</p>
<p>Only once Bitcoin is able to break back above its 21 and 50DMAs on a sustained basis could we declare that market momentum has swung decisively bullish once again.</p>
<p>In this case, a retest of yearly highs around $49,000 would be on the cards.</p>

<p>In the months ahead, focus will increasingly shift to the Bitcoin halving and Fed rate cuts.</p>
<p>The latter has historically been an important long-term bullish catalyst for the Bitcoin price.</p>
<p>Fed rate cuts have also historically boosted BTC.</p>
<p>A retest of all-time highs at $69,000 remain on the cards for 2024.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale has asserted that AI agents will &ldquo;probably&rdquo; use crypto when making transactions.</p>
<p></span><span>In an interview on CNBC&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/01/22/ai-is-going-to-be-a-technology-that-impacts-productivity-says-palantir-co-founder-joe-lonsdale.html"><span>&ldquo;Squawk Box&rdquo;</span></a><span> talk show, Lonsdale touched on the future of AI and its potential usage of crypto. </span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>When Squawk Box host Joe Kernen suggested that savvy investors who entered the market at the early stages of Bitcoin, when its value was $800 or even $8,000, made a wise move, implying it might be too late for others, Lonsdale countered by alluding to the potential emergence of an unexpected buyer. He specifically mentioned autonomous AI agents as a factor that could influence crypto&rsquo;s market dynamics.</span><span></p>
<p></span><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not going to be a whole new financial story driving it from the side of buyers necessarily,&rdquo; the Palantir co-founder said. &ldquo;Although, there&rsquo;s one type of buyer that&rsquo;s very important here &mdash; AI agents are going to start to do a lot of things in our economy and AI agents that coordinate with incentive systems are probably going to use crypto. So, if this AI story works out in consumer areas &hellip; everything to AI.&rdquo;</span><span></p>
<p></span><span>Squawk Box co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin responded saying that AI agents would most likely not be using Bitcoin, and would instead prefer to use other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum or Solana. </span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span> &ldquo;Those are the three they might use, and they&rsquo;re probably all correlated at the end of the day,&rdquo; Lonsdale replied to Sorkin. </span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>Earlier on the show, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/15-billion-palantir-firm-co-founder-says-most-crypto-companies-will-crash-heres-why.htm">Lonsdale</a> expanded on AI&rsquo;s tangible advantages, highlighting its potential to enhance profit margins. </span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>He specifically pointed to the healthcare billing sector, emphasizing that AI has the capability to double the margins in that area.</p>
<p></span><span>&ldquo;AI is going to be able to double the margins in that area, which means you pull $100 billion of spend out of the economy,&rdquo; Lonsdale predicted. </span><span><br />
</span><b></b></p>
<h2><b>Grayscale Weighs In</b><span><br />
</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>Crypto asset manager <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-sec-delays-grayscales-spot-eth-etf-application.htm">Grayscale</a> has also contributed to the discussion of the growing convergence between AI and crypto. The company recently published a </span><a href="https://www.grayscale.com/research/reports/the-emergence-of-ai-and-crypto-synergies?mkt_tok=MDAwLUVVRS0xMjUAAAGQvWWpLeUPdWnfJbPlQXNyc3vhjI3ABsEXmWJKtzbmIKpzG2DBhyBlqTOnjDm7MS-sbFUpNBZXg2FFagB9BR9twl1GmXhWOwdbIE9__6-j"><span>study</span></a><span> highlighting the possible benefits of the intersection between artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies.</span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>The company stated that future societal challenges related to AI, including issues like the proliferation of deepfakes, apprehensions surrounding data privacy, and the concentration of power, could be mitigated by developments in the relationship between AI and crypto.&nbsp;</span><span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As crypto markets brace for an anticipated bull-run this year, investors are increasingly looking for the best crypto to buy in 2024.</p>
<p>In this article, deep-dive three investment opportunities backed by strong crypto fundamentals for the year ahead.</p>
<p>Indeed, 2024 is an anticipated bull run year, with a duality of factors set to induce upside price moves across the crypto market.</p>
<p>Firstly, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-frenzy-begins-as-sec-finally-approves-first-spot-bitcoin-funds-bitcoin-remains-unresponsive.htm">approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month has opened the door to institutional demand for Bitcoin (demand side pressure).</p>
<p>This interacts with the secondary event, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halving.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin halving in April 2024</a>, which will see Bitcoin block rewards cut in half (inducing a supply shock in the market).</p>
<p>With more demand than ever, and soon to be less supply than ever, it’s anticipated that a Bitcoin bull run could be initiated.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Another Etheruem alternative gaining significant traction is Solana (SOL) – which is amongst the top-ranked layer-1 solutions and has in recent weeks unlocked significant growth due to a rise in gas fees across the ERC-20 network.</p>
<p>Subsequently burgeoning as the third most active chain in the space, Solana’s native SOL token has emerged as an unmistakably strong hold for the year ahead after posting <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSDT/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">+255% price gains</a> over the past 3-months &#8211; providing strong crypto fundamentals for a healthy bull run ahead.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy 2024: #2 &#8211; Chainlink (LINK)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />

<p>Top oracle project Chainlink (LINK) is well-poised in crypto fundamentals for dramatic growth in the year ahead, due to it&#8217;s vital position as backbone infrastructure for large swathes of the crypto industry and Web3</p>
<p>Operating as a decentralized data oracle, the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chainlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main purpose</a> of Chainlink is to provide secure external data-feeds to supply the needs of other crypto projects, with LINK token used as a means of settlement for data-feed usage &#8211; creating a constant demand-side pressure on price performance.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy 2024: #1 &#8211; Ordi Token (ORDI)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-157369 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1706281493-ordiusdt_2024-01-26_15-04-38.png" alt="Best crypto to buy 2024?

<p>Kick-starting our list with a slightly higher risk profile than following investments is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ordi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ordi token</a> (ORDI), which broke out onto crypto markets in 2023 as the first ever BRC-20 inscription token.</p>
<p>Still prominent as the largest BRC-20 token by market cap (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ordi/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">$1.57bn at the time of writing</a>), ORDI is used as a decentralized naming system for the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>ORDI is poised to unlock dramatic growth alongside Bitcoin’s anticipated skyrocket post-halving in 2024 – with the potential to outperform BTC due to a lower market cap position.</p>
<p>But while all of these tokens offer strong crypto fundamentals, a higher risk, higher return opportunity emerges in a project with environmental fundamental backing.</p>

<p>As the world grapples with climate change, the crypto industry continues to grapple with environmental sustainability, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eTukTuk</a> emerges as a beacon of innovation and ecological responsibility.</p>
<p>This ground-breaking project, currently in its presale phase, is not just another crypto token; it&#8217;s a revolutionary step towards transforming urban transportation in developing countries while addressing the critical issue of environmental degradation.</p>
<h2><strong>How is eTukTuk Revolutionizing Urban Mobility?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
At its core, eTukTuk is about more than just introducing a new cryptocurrency, it&#8217;s a comprehensive solution aimed at reducing carbon emissions, combating CO2-related health conditions, and fostering financial inclusion, particularly in developing countries.</p>
<p>The project&#8217;s main offering is an innovative electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVSE), tailored to meet the needs of cities and suburban areas in developing regions.</p>
<p>Alongside this, eTukTuk presents its proprietary EV model, designed to be both affordable and efficient, facilitating a seamless transition for drivers from traditional vehicles to eco-friendlier options.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2><strong>Blockchain at the Heart of Sustainable Transport: A Mission to Clean the Air</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The foundation of eTukTuk&#8217;s operations lies in deployment on the robust and efficient BNB Chain, backed by Binance.</p>
<p>This choice not only guarantees scalability and security but also aligns perfectly with eTukTuk&#8217;s core values of people-centric innovation, the integration of blockchain technology ensures a transparent, secure, and efficient framework, essential for the project&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>The mission of eTukTuk is straightforward yet impactful: to significantly reduce pollution from the prevalent 270 million traditional tuk-tuks worldwide.</p>
<p>By providing a cost-effective alternative in the form of electric tuk-tuks and a network of affordable charging stations, eTukTuk aims to make sustainable transportation accessible to all households.</p>

<p>A 40-year-old Russian developer of Trickbot ransomware has been sentenced to a five-year prison term, according to the US Department of Justice (DoJ).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-sentenced-involvement-development-and-deployment-trickbot-malware">press release</a> dated January 25, the DoJ identified the individual as Vladimir Dunaev from Amur Oblast, Russia. Court documents cited by the Justice Department reveal that Dunaev provided specialized services and technical expertise in the development of the Trickbot ransomware.</p>
<p>The malicious software was then used to target hospitals, schools, and millions of businesses&#8217; computer networks, resulting in substantial financial losses. The DoJ stated that Dunaev, along with 10 other co-conspirators, caused tens of millions of dollars in losses to these victims.</p>
<p>Providing an instance, the US DoJ revealed that 10 victims in the Northern District of Ohio, including Avon Schools and a North Canton real estate firm, lost more than $3.4 million to the ransomware deployed by Trickbot.</p>
<p>Trickbot, which was eventually taken down in 2022, operated as a suite of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cyber-criminals-target-crypto-investors-with-new-malware-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">malware tools</a> focused on secretly pilfering money from their target victims and installing malware that cannot be detected by anti-virus software scanners. Its anonymity facilitated continuous breaches of infected computers.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/trickbot-ransomware-malware-sanctions-september-2023/">Chainalysis report</a> in September 2023, Trickbot facilitated the deployment of several ransomware strains, including Ryuk, Conti, Diavol, and Karakurt. Using these tools, the Trickbot crew, as they were known, managed to pilfer $833 million worth of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy.htm">cryptocurrency assets</a> during their operation.</p>
<p>Dunaev is one of the team members facing a jail term. According to the DoJ, he will serve a five-year and four-month prison term after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit computer fraud and identity theft, as well as conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud.</p>
<p>The Russian national was initially arrested in 2021 in the Republic of Korea and then extradited to the US to face criminal charges.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dunaev’s co-conspirator, Alla Witte – a Latvian national – pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer fraud and was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison.</p>
<h2>Dunaev’s Co-conspirators Make OFAC’s Sanction List</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While other team members are currently at large, the US DoJ remains steadfast in its efforts to dismantle the notorious Trickbot cybercriminal syndicate.</p>
<p>In a September 2023 <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1714">press release</a>, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned 11 key members of the team. The case was done in collaboration with the UK government.</p>

<p>Crypto theft has become a major bug in the burgeoning crypto ecosystem. In 2023, a combined total of $1.7 billion in crypto losses was reported, according to a <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-hacking-stolen-funds-2024/">Chainalysis report</a>. Out of this total, cyber threat groups such as the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group claimed approximately $1 billion.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Funds stolen from crypto platforms in 2023 fell 54.3% to $1.7 billion. This is mostly due to a drop in DeFi hacking, which drove the increase in stolen crypto that we saw in 2021 and 2022. However, there still were several large DeFi hacks in 2023. <a href="https://t.co/s8Ix982HR2">pic.twitter.com/s8Ix982HR2</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While this figure looks outlandish, Chainalysis noted that the $1.7 billion loss is 54.3% lower than the $3.7 billion in crypto losses recorded in 2022.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The report attributed this decline to enhanced security measures, which have made it more challenging for crypto hackers to achieve successful paydays.</p>
