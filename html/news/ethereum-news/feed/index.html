<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on BlackRock’s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to March.</p>
<p>According to the SEC’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nasdaq/2024/34-99419.pdf">latest filing</a>, the new decision deadline for BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF is set to be March 10, 2024. The Commission will then approve, disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.</p>
<p>“Section 19(b)(2) of the Act4 provides that within 45 days of the publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule change,” wrote the SEC, “Or within such longer period up to 90 days as the Commission may designate if it finds such longer period to be appropriate.”</p>
<p>“The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,” wrote the SEC.</p>
<h2>More Delays Expected in Spot Ethereum ETF Decision</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In response to the postponement announcement, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart stated that the delayed decision was within anticipation.</p>
<p>“Spot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months,” said Seyffart. “Next date that matters is May 23rd.”</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-postpones-decision-on-fidelitys-spot-ethereum-etf.htm">Fidelity’s spot Ethereum ETF was also postponed</a> by the SEC. On Jan. 18, the Commission announced the delay in its filing and pushed the decision deadline to March 5.</p>
<p>“Completely expected,” Seyffart commented so regarding Fidelity’s application.</p>
<h2>Goldman Sachs Optimistic About Ethereum ETF Approval</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-ether-etf-goldman-sachs-sec-approval-confident.htm">Goldman Sachs</a>, expressed optimism about the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the coming months.</p>
<p>During a recent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/01/23/goldman-sachs-digital-assets-chief-explains-banks-participation-bitcoin-etf-boom.html">CNBC interview</a>, McDermott emphasized the critical factor determining the approval, &#8220;A big question naturally centers around whether it’s perceived to be a security or not,&#8221; McDermott stated, adding, &#8220;I think that will ultimately be determined, and on whether it gets approved.&#8221;</p>
<p>McDermott noted the cost-effective nature of investing in Bitcoin through these ETFs compared to direct crypto investment.</p>
<p>“Seeing big, regulated institutions having that ability to issue Bitcoin ETFs is a very powerful statement for the market,” said McDermott.</p>

<p>Last year in May, Ethereum co-founder <strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong> helped organize an exclusive two-month gathering called <strong>Zuzalu</strong> in Montenegro.</p>
<p>Around 200 invitees discussed <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/19/1073374/i-just-met-the-founders-of-a-would-be-longevity-state/">topics like cryptography and longevity</a> while enjoying dinners and swims along the Adriatic Sea coastline. Details were scarce, but the hush-hush retreat has now inspired a new initiative—spinoff &#8220;<strong>Zu-villages</strong>&#8221; funded by Ethereum grants.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Funds New &#8216;Zu-Villages&#8217; Inspired by Invite-Only Gathering</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A recent post on the blockchain crowdfunding platform <a href="https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/zuzalu-qf-grants-program-on-grants-stack">Gitcoin announced quarterly matching pools</a> totaling 250 ETH, around $590,000 at current prices. This has fueled speculation that Zuzalu may reconvene this year.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This past weekend I was fortunate enough to join the Zuzalu camp put on by <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@VitalikButerin</a> and others. <a href="https://twitter.com/afropolitan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@afropolitan</a> welcome me with opened arms and gave us all a sense of being and direction.</p>
<p>A short thread on my experience <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/rvL19e4ies">pic.twitter.com/rvL19e4ies</a></p>
<p>&mdash; jordan (@cryptosmiff) <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptosmiff/status/1654196425981579265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The stated goals are advancing &#8220;pop-up city&#8221; events and supporting technology-driven projects. Recipients can tap into two pools—166.5 ETH for events and 83.5 ETH for tech projects.</p>
<p>To qualify for the matched funds, at least one team member must have been invited to Zuzalu last year and participated for a minimum of one week. The blog post does not state if Zuzalu is happening again this year or provide details on timing or location.</p>
<p>Buterin is supposedly contributing a big portion of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-does-give-eth-but-who-receives-it-3101.htm">ETH grants</a>, although a representative later backtracked, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/01/22/zuzalu-vitalik-buterin-led-retreat-in-montenegro-inspires-grants-for-zu-villages/">telling CoinDesk</a> there is no record of Buterin committing funds. His precise involvement is unclear as of now.</p>
<h2>Zuzalu Retreat Shrouded in Mystery</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Zuzalu retreat itself is shrouded in some secrecy. It was never announced beforehand and details trickled out after the fact via social media posts. Some paint it as a glorified camp discussing esoteric topics, while others reference a Silicon Valley exclusivity.</p>
<p><iframe title="Is &quot;Zuzalu&quot; an Utopian Society? Vitalik Buterin Explains | #InnoMinds" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RL2IHg-U6E8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>But it seemingly made an impression on Buterin and other creators who hope to replicate the temporary community under the Zu-village banner. The requirement of at least one core member who attended Zuzalu 2023 hints at an air of exclusivity around the new pop-ups as well.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its ruling on Fidelity’s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund until March 5th, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2024/34-99390.pdf">a new court filing reveals</a>.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">“Completely expected”</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">“The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,” the Thursday filing reads in part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">News of the decision of the spot Ethereum ETF’s delay comes just a week after the SEC approved <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-history/">a long-awaited spot Bitcoin ETF</a>, a decision which many in the crypto community feel will greatly increase greater mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency across the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fidelity</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ethereum?src=hashtag_click"><span style="font-weight: 400"> #ethereum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> ETF delayed just now. Completely expected. Dates that really matter are late May in my view,” Bloomberg ETF analyst, James Seyffart, posted to X.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Coinbase and the SEC faceoff in-court</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">News of the SEC’s delay comes amidst its legal fight against Coinbase, with the federal agency alleging the exchange sold unregistered securities on its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Coinbase pushed back against the SEC’s allegations during Wednesday’s hearing, arguing that none of the platform’s tokens count as securities at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Judge Katherine Polk Failla, who is overseeing the case, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arguments-conclude-in-coinbase-and-sec-case-judge-failla-holds-on-decision.htm">refused to make a decision</a> on it as of Wednesday afternoon, citing concerns of regulatory encroachment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I worry that I would be doing exactly the thing you’re alleging the Commission is doing here, which is to take power that I don’t have to stop activity I shouldn’t be stopping,” Judge Failla told a lawyer for Coinbase.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Under pressure</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, the SEC is facing criticism for its extensive enforcement approach in regards to cryptocurrency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In an amicus curiae brief in support of Coinbase, Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) claimed the federal agency’s desire to classify cryptocurrencies as securities “exceeds the SEC’s authority, encroaches on Congress’s lawmaking, and contravenes the separation of powers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Similarly, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed his own disdain at the SEC’s leadership during a conversation at the World Economic Forum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do think the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, is a political liability in the United States,” <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ripple-ceo-brad-garlinghouse-says-gensler-is-a-political-liability-report.htm">Garlinghouse</a> told </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/16/ripple-ceo-calls-us-sec-chair-gary-gensler-a-political-liability.html?taid=65a656a3e3a6540001804cba&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter%7Cmain%5C%22"><span style="font-weight: 400">CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. “And I think he’s not acting in the interests of the citizenry, he’s not acting in the interests of the long-term growth of the economy, and I don’t understand it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It remains unclear what asset class the SEC will designate Ethereum as.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum has successfully implemented the Dencun network upgrade on the Goerli testnet.</p>
<p>On Jan. 17, Ethereum&rsquo;s developers have deployed the previously <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/01/10/goerli-dencun-announcement" rel="sponsored">announced Dencun upgrade</a>, succeeding the Shapella upgrade (also known as the Shanghai upgrade) in 2023.</p>
<p>The Dencun upgrade prominently features the implementation of EIP-4844, known as proto-danksharding. Proto-danksharding, as the main component, allows for the temporary storage of off-chain data, easing the storage demands on Ethereum nodes.</p>
<p>This development is anticipated to significantly lower transaction fees for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/top-10-decentralized-exchanges-dex.htm">decentralized</a> applications (dApps), particularly benefiting Layer 2 rollup chains.
</p>
<h2>Dencun is Goerli Testnet&#8217;s Last Upgrade</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
According to the Ethereum core team, the Dencun upgrade will be the <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/11/30/goerli-lts-update" rel="sponsored">last upgrade</a> for the Goerli testnet, Ethereum&#8217;s first multi-client testnet, before the developers stop supporting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either three months after the Goerli Dencun activation, or one month after the Dencun mainnet activation, whichever comes later, teams will begin exiting their validators,&rdquo; said the team. &ldquo;Anyone relying on Goerli as a stable testnet should migrate elsewhere prior to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Application and tooling developers are encouraged to use Sepolia to test decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other EVM functionality,&rdquo; said the team. &ldquo;Stakers and infrastructure providers concerned with protocol-level testing are encouraged to use the newly launched Holesky testnet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The upgrade is named &#8220;Dencun&#8221; as it combines the naming conventions for Ethereum&#8217;s consensus and execution layer upgrades. Consensus layer upgrades are typically named after stars, while execution layer upgrades follow the names of Devcon city locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dencun&#8221; merges &#8220;Deneb,&#8221; a first-magnitude star in the Cygnus constellation, with &#8220;Cancun,&#8221; the host city for Devcon 3, reflecting the collaborative nature of the upgrade across both layers of Ethereum&#8217;s architecture.</p>
<p>The upgrade was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbhFdUFnWUU" rel="sponsored">livestreamed</a> by the developers. If no major issues are found following the Goerli implementation, it will be deployed to Sepolia and Holesky.

<h2>Buterin Says Validiums are Not Genuine Rollup Solutions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Ethereum co-founder <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-says-validiums-are-not-genuine-rollup-solutions.htm">Vitalik Buterin</a> has recently sparked a debate about the classification of layer 2 scaling solutions, particularly focusing on Ethereum&#8217;s validiums. Buterin asserts that validiums, which use off-chain data storage, should not be considered true rollup solutions.</p>
<p>Validiums, while offering scalability through zero-knowledge proofs for off-chain transactions, face challenges in terms of data availability, differing from ZK-rollups which post full transaction data on the Ethereum mainnet.</p>
<p>The discussion in the Ethereum community regarding the evolution and categorization of its scaling solutions has become increasingly relevant as Ethereum now moves forward with its Dencun upgrade.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, has ignited a debate about the classification of various layer 2 scaling solutions.</p>
<p>The crypto veteran has claimed that Ethereum&#8217;s validiums should not be considered genuine rollup solutions.</p>
<p>The statement came <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1747193558204105006" rel="sponsored">in response to a post by Daniel Wang</a>, the founder of Taiko, an Ethereum rollup solution, who said if an Ethereum rollup relies on an external data chain, such as Celestia&#8217;s modular blockchain, then it should be classified as a validium.</p>
<p>Buterin concurred with Wang&#8217;s comment, stating:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is correct. The core of being a rollup is the unconditional security guarantee: you can get your assets out even if everyone else colludes against you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He emphasized that if data availability depends on an external system, that security guarantee cannot be upheld.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is correct.</p>
<p>The core of being a rollup is the unconditional security guarantee: you can get your assets out even if everyone else colludes against you. Can&#39;t get that if DA is dependent on an external system.</p>
<p>But being a validium is a correct choice for many apps, and…</p>
<p>&mdash; vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1747193558204105006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</p>
<h2>What is Validium?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Validium is a scaling solution for Ethereum that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable off-chain transactions, while still relying on the Ethereum mainnet for security and verification.</p>
<p>Unlike ZK-rollups, which batch transactions on a layer 2 network and verify them on a layer 1 like Ethereum, validium networks do not post transaction data to layer 1.</p>
<p>Instead, they post cryptographic proofs of transaction validity, aiming to achieve higher scalability by avoiding the need to store full transaction data on-chain.</p>
<p>However, compared to rollups, validiums face challenges in terms of data availability, as they rely on operators to honestly post proofs.</p>
<p>Networks like Celestia employ modular blockchains consisting of data availability layers and validation layers, with validiums facilitating fast and private transactions.</p>
<p>Buterin took to the decentralized social media platform Warpcast to share a diagram proposing adjustments to terminologies related to these scaling solutions.</p>
<p>He suggested replacing terms like &#8220;security-favoring&#8221; and &#8220;scale-favoring&#8221; with &#8220;strong&#8221; and &#8220;light&#8221; to achieve greater brevity.
</p>
<h2>Some Argue Validiums Should Be Considered L2 Networks</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
While Buterin&#8217;s proposals garnered support, not everyone agreed.</p>
<p>Ryan Berckmans, a member of the Ethereum community, argued that validiums should be considered layer 2 networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;A layer-2 is a chain that settles on Ethereum. I&#8217;ll die on this hill, and I&#8217;ll debate anyone who insists the [data availability] has to be on Ethereum for it to be an L2,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Berckmans believed that the definition of layer 2 should encompass both rollups and validiums.</p>
<p>However, a layer 2 industry analytics platform called L2Beat contradicted Berckmans&#8217; perspective, asserting that validiums are not layer 2 solutions.</p>
<p>According to L2Beat, validiums and optimiums introduce additional trust assumptions by not publishing data on layer 1.</p>
<p>As reported, Ethereum-based layer 2 network Arbitrum now <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrum-dominates-with-nearly-50-of-ethereum-layer-2-total-value-locked.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has a market share of 49.17%</span></a> among layer 2 networks, far surpassing number two on the list, Optimism Mainnet, with its 28.85% market share.</p>
<p>The network has also seen a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrums-total-value-locked-surges-past-2-5-billion-as-token-nears-2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">consistent increase in its TVL</span></a> at least since October last year, rising about 50% from $1.66 billion in October to the current value of $2.51 billion, data from DeFi tracking site DefiLlama showed.</p>
<p>The <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereums-upcoming-upgrade-cancun-deneb-set-to-begin-testing-on-january-17.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade</span></a>, incorporating changes proposed by EIP-4844, is expected to reduce rollup transaction costs, benefiting layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum by lowering gas fees and improving network capacity.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the wake of this long-awaited Bitcoin ETF milestone, the spotlight has shifted to whether <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/11/ether-price-spikes-on-hope-of-eth-etf-but-will-the-sec-approve-it.html" rel="sponsored">Ethereum could be next to receive SEC approval</a> for an ETF tracking the second <strong>most valuable cryptocurrency</strong>.
</p>
<h2>ETH Spikes on Bitcoin ETF Launch</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/" rel="sponsored">Ethereum&#8217;s price spiked</a></p>
<p>to its highest point since May 2022 following the Bitcoin ETF news, as investors anticipated an Ethereum ETF could also become a reality. Applications for <strong>spot ETH ETF</strong>s are pending before the SEC, with decisions expected beginning in May 2024. Major finance firms like BlackRock, F&#305;delity, Invesco, Ark, and VanEck have applied for Ethereum ETF approvals.</p>
<p>Comments from SEC Chair Gary Gensler have cast uncertainty over the prospect, however. After approving the Bitcoin funds, Gensler emphasized they were for a &#8220;non-security commodity&#8221; and that the decision did not indicate a willingness to approve ETFs for other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Importantly, today&rsquo;s Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission&rsquo;s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023" rel="sponsored">Gensler said Wednesday</a> after the SEC decision on Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>This distinction matters because the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/secs-gensler-remains-resolute-push-for-crypto-regulation-ahead-of-senate-committee-appearance.htm">SEC views most cryptocurrencies as securities</a>, while Bitcoin is classified as a commodity. With Ethereum viewed by the SEC as a security, its path to ETF approval could face hurdles.
</p>
<h2>Experts Divided on Ethereum ETF Approval Odds</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Some industry voices believe an Ethereum ETF could still receive approval this year, pointing to the SEC&#8217;s evolving stance toward cryptocurrency vehicles.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> reached the level I&#39;ve mentioned for the past months. </p>
<p>I think we&#39;ll consolidate. The news is out, the ETF is live, it&#39;s great.</p>
<p>Rotation towards Ethereum. <a href="https://t.co/zH8CC5oJhf">pic.twitter.com/zH8CC5oJhf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1745469788418183310?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d watch what the SEC does and not what it says, because it wasn&rsquo;t long ago that the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF seemed like a distant dream,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/AntoniNexo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" rel="sponsored">Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev</a> told CNBC. &#8220;Things move very fast in crypto and investors are front-running what they believe to be the next big spot ETF approval,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others are more doubtful of quick approval for Ethereum given <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gary-gensler-maintains-stance-on-crypto-despite-secs-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval.htm">Gensler&#8217;s recent warnings</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as [Gensler]&#8217;s in power, it&rsquo;s less likely, frankly, but I do think it&rsquo;s eventually likely,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/Scaramucci?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" rel="sponsored">SkyBridge Capital founder&nbsp;Anthony Scaramucci</a> said. &#8220;He&rsquo;ll probably block ETH. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean ETH isn&rsquo;t coming. I think it just requires patience. It may be early on that trade, but ETH is here to stay as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For now, the Bitcoin ETF approvals have shown the SEC is opening up to allowing mainstream cryptocurrency investment vehicles. But the agency appears to be moving cautiously, as evidenced by its hesitancy around Ethereum so far.</p>
<p>Whether mounting industry pressure and surging investor demand could accelerate the timeline for an Ethereum ETF approval is unclear. With the Bitcoin barrier now broken, Wall Street will be watching closely for signs of movement on an Ethereum fund.</p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On Tuesday evening, the official <strong>X account of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</strong> was <strong>hacked</strong> and posted an unauthorized message stating that regulators had approved a <strong>Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)</strong>.</p>
<p>The now-deleted tweet sparked a brief <strong>rally in cryptocurrency markets</strong> before the <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1744833049064288387">SEC clarified that the account had been compromised</a>. While the tweet was bogus, the knee-jerk reaction has provided insight into how cryptocurrencies may respond to future <strong>Bitcoin ETF approvals</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well, we&#39;ve got fake news on the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETF approval for the third time.</p>
<p>This time an hack on the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SEC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SEC</a> account.</p>
<p>Theory remains, upside relatively skewed, might reach $51K and then the rotation towards <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ETH</a> happens. </p>
<p>Atleast $48K touched and Ethereum is taking of.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a> <a href="https://t.co/onHfZ0H3Kf">pic.twitter.com/onHfZ0H3Kf</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Spikes on Fake Bitcoin ETF News</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In particular, <strong>the price of Ethereum</strong> surged on the fake news. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">Ethereum volume spiked</a> 73% to nearly $22 billion as prices reached a peak of 9.3% intraday. The major increase despite the tweet referencing Bitcoin suggests that an actual Bitcoin ETF approval could also act as a catalyst for Ethereum as traders selling the news rotate into ETH in anticipation of an <strong>Ethereum ETF approval</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone is concerned with what Bitcoin will do when the ETF gets approved,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/scottmelker/status/1745032290026106954?t=7EhIg5aJg_TuFEf7Rbg3Kg&amp;s=19">tweeted crypto analyst Scott Melker</a>. &#8220;Yesterday&#8217;s insanity gave us the road map&#8230; traders will rotate into Ethereum. The market has spoken.&#8221;</p>
<p>If <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">cryptocurrency</a> prices can spike based on a fake tweet, one can only imagine the potential impact of real news.</p>
<p>The long-awaited <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-imminent-secs-key-decision-expected-this-week.htm">SEC decision on a Bitcoin ETF</a> is expected later today. While the regulatory agency has rejected all proposals so far, many believe prospects are improving for approval.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just based on the charts it appears the ethereum ETF has been approved</p>
<p>&mdash; Dyme (@CryptoParadyme) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoParadyme/status/1745119704388452498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>If approved, a Bitcoin ETF would make the cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/emerging-technologies-collaborative/blog/2023/a-year-of-tremors-and-triumphs-a-retrospective-on-the-crypto-industry.html">more accessible to mainstream investors</a>, boosting demand and having spillover effects for other major coins like Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Prague Upgrade Generates Optimism</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Beyond the price movements sparked by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/x-confirms-us-secs-official-account-was-indeed-hacked.htm">Tuesday&#8217;s fake tweet</a>, Ethereum has an upcoming network upgrade that could also impact prices.</p>
<p>The Ethereum blockchain is on the verge of the <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/ethereum-upgrade-when-is-it-going-live">Dencun upgrade</a>, an imminent technical improvement to the platform. This upgrade has generated excitement within the cryptocurrency community as it seeks to enhance Ethereum&#8217;s functionality, security, and overall capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zkxprotocol/status/1743626072527352001">Investors and analysts expect</a> this upgrade to have a bullish effect on Ethereum&#8217;s price. The modifications could serve as a catalyst for an ETH price surge, propelling values higher.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s fake tweet provided a small preview of what may be on the horizon. The industry awaits the SEC&#8217;s announcement with bated breath. A positive decision could unleash the next leg up for the nascent asset class. As traders anticipate the <strong>Ethereum ETF approval</strong>, there may be huge upside for the cryptocurrency after <strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s ETF approval.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Valkyrie Funds Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg says it wouldn’t be surprising if a Ripple and Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) came to the market speaking in an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1744797194958365133?s=20">Bloomberg TV. </a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if we saw Ripple or Ethereum spot ETFs out there,&#8221; said McClurg. The CIO went on to add that Grayscale recently added XRP to their publicly traded which in turn shows that there is interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">McClurg believes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The SEC will deem the ETFs effective at close of business Wednesday and the trading to begin on Thursday morning,” McClurg said <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ceos-of-spot-bitcoin-etf-hopefuls-expect-trading-to-begin-thursday.htm">in an interview</a>.</span></p>
<h2><b>Dozen Applications in Pipeline </b></h2>

<p>According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1744851796680429948">James Seyffart</a>, Fidelity <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fee-war-intensifies-bitcoin-etf-issuers-submit-updates-lowering-rates.htm">lowered their fees</a> to 0.25% from the previous 0.39% and has offered a fee waiver to 0% through July 31.</p>
<p>Including Fidelity, 5 out of the 11 issuers have revised their fee structures or offered temporary waivers after they <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-applicants-to-file-updated-s1-form-after-secs-comments-a-delay-signal.htm">received feedback</a> from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 8.</p>
<p>With the previously lowest fee of 0.24% offered already, Bitwise reduced it to 0.20% with a waiver to 0% for 6 months or 1 billion; Wisdomtree lowered its fee of 0.50% to 0.30% also with a waiver to 0% for 6 months or 1 billion.</p>

<p>An Ethereum (ETH) spot ETF is due to reach the U.S. market after a slew of Bitcoin (BTC) based equivalents are likely greenlighted next week, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.</p>
<p>During a private webinar with CryptoQuant on Thursday, the analyst argued that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has quietly recognized ETH as a commodity rather than a security, placing it in the same regulatory category as BTC.</p>
<p>“The SEC has approved Ethereum futures ETFs,” noted Seyffart, referring to the mass approval of funds from VanEck, ProShares, Bitwise, and Valkyrie in August.</p>
<p>Sponsors were inspired to apply at the time after witnessing the SEC approve the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF in June. This signalled to the market that regulators might now be willing to list crypto products with a higher risk profile, like Ethereum futures.</p>
<p>“So again, Gary Gensler will not explicitly say whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity, but in their action, by approving those Ethereum futures ETFs, they’re implicitly accepting those Ethereum futures as commodities futures,” explained Seyffart.</p>
<p>The distinction is important: commodities and securities face different regulatory, tax, and reporting requirements, with greater burdens arguable attached to the latter.</p>
<p>The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – the SEC’s sibling market regulator – has long considered both BTC and ETH to be commodities.</p>
<p>By contrast, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has long kept a tight lip regarding ETH’s classification, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-boss-gensler-doesnt-mention-ethereum-as-a-commodity-does-not-say-bitcoin-is-the-only-one-either.htm">dodging</a> interviewers when probed on the matter.</p>
<p>That said, the agency excluded mentioning ETH in its lawsuits against <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-arguments-to-dismiss-lawsuit-lack-merit-sec-argues-in-new-filing.htm">Binance</a> and Coinbase last year, which named dozens of other top cryptos including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) as securities.</p>
<h2>Likelihood Of ETF Approval</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The SEC has also offered few explicit details about whether it will approve or deny Bitcoin spot ETF applications its received from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and others, only <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-gary-gensler-says-sec-taking-new-look-at-spot-btc-etfs-approval-coming.htm">noting</a> that it’s making a “fresh evaluation” of such proposals after losing its court case with Grayscale in August.</p>
<p>Given rising engagement and discussion with applicants in recent months, analysts like Seyffart assign a 90% likelihood to ETFs being approved early next week. Ethereum ETFs aren’t quite so guaranteed yet, but the SEC will have a hard time denying them. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It wouldn’t just be the SEC going against the crypto industry. If they call Ethereum a security, it’ll be going against their sister regulator, CFTC.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Ethereum Foundation has <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/01/03/devcon-sea-announcement">announced</a> that Devcon 7, the Ethereum developer conference, will be hosted in Bangkok, Thailand, from November 12 to 15, 2024. The decision reflects an expansion of the event&#8217;s vision, with a focus on embracing the entire Southeast Asia region as the stage for the community gathering.</p>
<p>The Ethereum Foundation expressed its excitement about the potential and rapid growth of the Ethereum community in Southeast Asia. The decision to schedule Devcon 7 for 2024 allows for a more significant impact on regional Ethereum communities. The Foundation aims to engage more deeply with local communities, providing support and empowerment in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, Devcon 7 will be a more inclusive and regionally focused event, and to reflect this vision, it will be called &#8220;Devcon Southeast Asia&#8221; rather than being named after the host city. The event is expected to resonate across Southeast Asia, showcasing the vibrant Ethereum community in the region.</p>
<p>The choice of Bangkok, Thailand, as the host city aligns with the region&#8217;s significant potential and rapid growth in cryptocurrency adoption. The Ethereum community in countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand ranks highly in the Global Crypto Adoption Index, underscoring the pivotal role of Southeast Asia in the global Ethereum landscape.</p>
<p>The decision to focus on Southeast Asia is driven not only by the region&#8217;s significant potential and rapid cryptocurrency adoption but also by its diverse cultures, rich histories, and vibrant communities. </p>
<p>&#8220;Devcon Southeast Asia&#8221; aims to resonate across the region, showcasing the vibrant Ethereum community and enveloping the diverse cultures and energy of Southeast Asia. The chosen host city, Bangkok, Thailand, with its unique blend of tradition and modernity, is considered an ideal location in terms of venue suitability and global accessibility. The event is expected to provide a platform for meaningful engagement with local communities and further empower the Ethereum ecosystem in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>As of the latest update, the live <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> (ETH) price is $2,218.64 USD, reflecting a 5.78% decrease in the last 24 hours.</p>
<h2><strong>Ethereum Foundation&#8217;s Road to Devcon Grants Foster Community Growth in Southeast Asia</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In a bid to support and nurture Ethereum events, grassroots communities, and educational initiatives in Southeast Asia, the Ethereum Foundation (EF) initiated <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/06/29/road-to-devcon7-grants">the Road to Devcon (RTD)</a> Grants round on June 29, 2023. The grant round is specifically aimed at individuals based in Southeast Asia who are actively building communities, developing educational activities, and contributing to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem in the region.</p>
<p>The EF encouraged applicants to propose smaller meet-ups instead of large events, with the maximum grant awarded being $1,000. The initiative aims to empower the Southeast Asian Ethereum community by providing support along the Road to Devcon. The application deadline for the grants was set for November 30, 2023, at 23:59 UTC.</p>
<p>According to the recent announcement, the EF expressed satisfaction with the enthusiastic response and innovative proposals received from countries such as Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, and other neighboring Southeast Asian nations. The grants serve as a means to recognize and support the efforts of individuals and projects that contribute to shaping the Ethereum ecosystem in the region.</p>
<h2><strong>Vietnam Tops Southeast Asia in Global Crypto Adoption Index</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to recent research by Chainalysis, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vietnam-ranks-1st-in-crypto-adoption-usa-is-5th-china-back-in-top-10-chainalysis.htm">Vietnam</a> has emerged as a leader in cryptocurrency adoption within Southeast Asia, securing the top spot in the region and claiming the third position globally in the Global Crypto Adoption Index for 2023. This index is determined based on transaction volumes and protocols, taking into account web traffic patterns and weighting factors such as population size and purchasing power.</p>
<p>Vietnam&#8217;s robust performance in the Global Crypto Adoption Index highlights the country&#8217;s growing enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The research places other Southeast Asian nations in varying positions, with the Philippines, Indonesia, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/thailand/">Thailand</a> securing the 6th, 7th, and 10th spots, respectively. Notably, Singapore lags at the 77th position.</p>
<p>The competition among Southeast Asian countries to establish themselves as crypto hubs is evident, with each nation adopting different regulatory approaches to balance the potential of Web3 with safe and efficient practices. While Singapore and Thailand have implemented stricter measures, Vietnam&#8217;s favorable ranking suggests its positive reception and adoption of cryptocurrencies within the region.</p>

<p><b>Blockchain technology</b> is witnessing a major shift—one that promises to reshape how we think about and interact with <b>digital ledgers</b>. We&#8217;re talking about the emergence of parallelized <b>Ethereum Virtual Machines</b> (EVMs), a development that may redefine transaction processing in blockchain networks.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs offer an alternative to how blockchain networks currently manage and process transactions. By reducing congestion, especially during periods of high demand, <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fanl/papers/parallel-icse22.pdf">parallel execution</a> offers a more streamlined and efficient experience for users.</p>
<h2>Understanding Parallelized EVMs and Their Impact on Blockchain</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Historically, the execution of operations in blockchain networks has followed a <b>sequential pattern</b>. Each transaction within a block is processed one after the other, demanding comprehensive validation from the network. While this method has underpinned the robust and secure nature of blockchain technology, it has not been without its drawbacks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What Is The EVM In 2 Minutes (Ethereum Virtual Machine)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTlT3I-Iy5o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4274&amp;context=thesesdissertations">Sequential processing</a> is both energy-intensive and places a high workload on network validators. The result has often been <b>high transaction costs</b> and a <b>less efficient user experience</b>—issues that have frequently been cited as barriers to wider <b>blockchain adoption</b>.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs transform the consensus process by enabling multiple operations to be executed simultaneously. The parallel execution capability greatly increases the <b>network&#8217;s throughput</b>, enhancing the overall performance and <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/89f5c7cd-c139-486c-8f35-00f15d7b21fe/content">scalability of the blockchain</a>.</p>
<p>With Parallelized EVMs, blockchain networks can handle more transactions in a shorter period, effectively addressing <b>congestion issues</b> and <b>slow processing times</b> that have often plagued traditional blockchain systems.</p>
<p>The impact extends to various aspects of blockchain technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>It offers a more <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6287639/10005208/10102454.pdf">energy-efficient approach</a> to transaction processing. By reducing the workload on validators and the network at large, parallelized EVMs contribute to a more <b>sustainable blockchain</b> ecosystem.</li>
<li>The enhanced scalability and increased throughput directly translate to reduced transaction fees. Users benefit from a more <b>cost-effective</b> experience, making blockchain platforms more accessible and appealing to a broader audience.</li>
<li>The ability to process multiple transactions concurrently rather than sequentially means <b>decentralized applications</b> (dApps) can operate more seamlessly, even during periods of high network demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>This technological advancement not only improves the user experience but also opens new possibilities for complex and high-volume applications on the blockchain.</p>

The benefits of parallelized EVMs are not confined to Ethereum alone. They are also being integrated into other blockchain platforms, such as Solana, which is known for its <a href="https://solana.com/news/case-study-pyth">high throughput and low latency</a>.</p>
<p>By adopting a parallelized EVM on a platform like Solana, the potential for scalability and performance is magnified. This integration allows for a seamless execution of transactions across multiple nodes concurrently, greatly enhancing the network&#8217;s capacity to handle large volumes of transactions.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This advancement is particularly crucial for a wide range of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-build-decentralized-application-dapp.htm">decentralized applications</a>. Whether it&#8217;s in the DeFi, gaming, decentralized autonomous organizations, or <strong>decentralized exchanges</strong>, the adoption of parallelized EVMs will ensure that these applications can operate efficiently without overwhelming the network.</p>
<p>This is a critical factor in ensuring the long-term viability and success of dApps, as it addresses <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/24941/blockchain-and-the-scalability-challenge-solving-the-blockchain-trilemma">one of the biggest challenges they face</a>: scalability.</p>
<h3>The Developer&#8217;s Role in Maximizing Benefits</h3>
<p>The successful implementation and optimization of parallelized EVMs are heavily reliant on the foresight and skill of developers. To fully harness the <a href="https://suipiens.com/blog/understanding-parallel-execution-in-blockchain/">capabilities of parallelized technology</a> in blockchain, developers must integrate considerations for parallel processing from the inception of their projects.</p>
<p>This is particularly crucial when designing <strong>smart contracts</strong> and data structures, as these elements play a key role in determining whether transactions can be executed in parallel.</p>
<p>In the context of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm">smart contracts</a>, the design must accommodate parallel execution to ensure different transactions can operate independently without interference. For example, if a smart contract utilizes the same data structure for various transactions, it restricts the possibility of <strong>parallel processing</strong>. Developers must carefully structure their contracts and associated data to avoid such limitations.</p>
<p>The requirement for thoughtful design extends to <strong>data structures</strong> as well. Effective use of parallelized EVMs necessitates data structures that support <strong>independent transactions</strong>. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of transaction processing but also ensures that the full potential of parallelized technology is leveraged.</p>
<p>The role of developers, therefore, is not just about coding but also about <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37902833/">architectural planning</a> and strategic thinking. By designing with parallel processing in mind, developers can create dApps that are not only novel but also capable of operating at an unprecedented scale and efficiency.</p>
<p>This proactive approach is essential in unlocking the power of parallelized EVMs, making blockchain technology more <strong>adaptable, efficient, and scalable</strong>.</p>
<h2>Comparing Parallelized EVMs with DAG</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As a scalable blockchain technology, parallelized EVMs represent a major advancement. It&#8217;s instructive to compare them with other scalable technologies, however, such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34460402/">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</a>, to appreciate their unique contributions and potential in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>DAG presents an alternative approach to achieving scalability. Unlike traditional blockchains that chain blocks in a linear sequence, DAG structures allow <a href="https://hedera.com/learning/distributed-ledger-technologies/directed-acyclic-graph">transactions to be linked in a graph format</a>, where multiple transactions can be added concurrently.</p>
<figure id="attachment_145839" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145839" style="width: 1227px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-145839 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt.png" alt="Directed Acyclic Graph vs Blockchain" width="1227" height="323" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt.png 1227w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-300x79.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-1024x270.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-768x202.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1703779006-dlt-150x39.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1227px) 100vw, 1227px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-145839" class="wp-caption-text">Image by <a href="https://www.cbcamerica.org/blockchain-insights/dag-the-dlt-directed-acyclic-graph-for-enterprise-blockchain">Central Blockchain Council</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This structure substantially reduces the time needed for transaction confirmation and increases the network&#8217;s ability to handle <strong>high transaction volumes</strong>. DAG technology is known for its low transaction fees and high scalability, making it an attractive choice for applications requiring fast and efficient transaction processing.</p>
<p>Parallelized EVMs offer distinct advantages over DAG, however, particularly in the context of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/top-5-ethereum-dapp-games-1979.htm">Ethereum-based applications</a>. While DAG excels in transaction speed and scalability, it does not inherently support smart contracts and decentralized applications in the same way Ethereum does.</p>
<p>They retain the robust smart contract capabilities of Ethereum while enhancing scalability and efficiency through parallel processing. This makes them particularly suitable for complex decentralized applications that require both smart contract functionality and high transaction throughput.</p>
<p>Additionally, parallelized EVMs maintain compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem, which is a critical consideration for developers and users already entrenched in Ethereum-based applications. This compatibility ensures a smoother transition and integration for existing dApps, which is a challenge in DAG-based systems that often require major modifications to existing applications.</p>
<h2>Spotlight on Projects Developing Parallelized EVMs</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The evolution of parallelized EVMs is not occurring in isolation. Several projects are leading the charge of this technological shift, each contributing unique insights and advancements to the blockchain world.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A key aspect of SEI v2 is its commitment to backward compatibility, which is expected to facilitate the smooth migration and continued operation of existing Ethereum-based applications.</p>
<p>Additionally, SEI v2 plans to introduce <a href="https://twitter.com/jayendra_jog/status/1738393189302829449">SeiDB</a>, a novel data structure designed to enhance the platform&#8217;s performance. This development is particularly relevant in addressing the <strong>issue of state bloat</strong>, a challenge that has been a concern in blockchain networks. SeiDB&#8217;s role in potentially improving the overall performance and scalability of the SEI network could be a critical factor in its adoption and success.</p>
<h3>Neon EVM: Bridging Ethereum and Solana</h3>
<p><a href="https://neonevm.org/">Neon EVM</a> distinguishes itself as the first EVM compatible with Solana, leveraging <strong>Solana&#8217;s parallel processing</strong> capabilities. This unique fusion allows Neon EVM to offer <strong>Ethereum developer</strong>s the benefits of Solana&#8217;s network, such as low fees, high transaction speeds, and parallel execution, without requiring big changes to their existing <strong>Solidity</strong> or <strong>Vyper-based dApps</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The integration with Solana ensures stable transaction costs and takes advantage of the high throughput and swift block speeds inherent to Solana&#8217;s architecture.</p>
<h3>Monad: The Future of Ethereum-Compatible Blockchains</h3>
<p><a href="https://monad.xyz/">Monad</a> represents the next step in <strong>Ethereum-compatible Layer 1</strong> blockchains. Currently in development, with a <strong>testnet launch</strong> anticipated in Q1 2024, Monad seeks to balance decentralization with scalability, targeting a throughput of 10,000 transactions per second.</p>
<p>Its compatibility with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/federico-kunze-kullmer-evmos-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-on-cosmos-437.htm">Ethereum&#8217;s Virtual Machine</a> means that developers familiar with Ethereum can easily transition to Monad. The platform&#8217;s design incorporates various optimizations, such as MonadBFT and <a href="https://docs.monad.xyz/technical-discussion/consensus/deferred-execution">Deferred Execution</a>, to boost performance.</p>
<p>Additionally, Monad&#8217;s architecture will support asynchronous, parallel execution of EVM transactions, enhancing its processing capabilities and positioning it as a potential game-changer in the blockchain space.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Contrary to popular belief, parallel execution is not what brings the ultimate performance enhancement.</p>
<p>You first need to build a custom database that enables parallel access to state.</p>

<p>Ethereum co-founder <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-proposes-enshrined-zk-evm-for-enhanced-ethereum-main-chain-efficiency.htm">Vitalik Buterin</a> has proposed three alternative methods aimed at simplifying the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/donald-trump-sells-2-4-million-ethereum-arkham-intelligence.htm">Ethereum</a> blockchain&#8217;s proof of stake design.</p>
<p>This initiative, according to Buterin’s latest <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/sticking-to-8192-signatures-per-slot-post-ssf-how-and-why/17989">blog post</a>, is intended to address a potential systemic complexity within Ethereum&#8217;s consensus mechanism. The proposals center on reducing the number of signatures required per slot in the blockchain.</p>
<p>According to Buterin, Ethereum is currently supporting 895,000 validator objects for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/iosco-publishes-policy-recommendations-for-decentralized-finance-defi.htm">decentralization</a>, processing about 28,000 signatures in a single day and 1,790,000 post-SSF. His detailed idea intended to reduce the load to 8,192 signatures per slot post-SSF.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Proof of Stake Simplification Proposal</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Buterin&#8217;s first proposal, the shift towards decentralized staking pools, aims to simplify the proof of stake process by reducing the number of individual validators. This approach requires increasing the minimum ether required for staking, thereby compelling smaller validators to form pools.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.<a href="https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g">https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;We could raise the min deposit size to 4,096 <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-sec-delays-hashdex-and-grayscale-ethereum-based-etfs-whats-going-on.htm">ETH</a> and make a total cap of 4,096 validators,&#8221; said Buterin.</p>
<p>The second proposal introduces a dual-layer of stakers to ensure network security and efficiency. Buterin explained this as creating &#8220;a &#8216;heavy&#8217; layer with a 4,096 ETH requirement that participates in finalization, and a &#8216;light&#8217; layer with no minimum.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buterin&#8217;s third proposal, involving a rotating set of validators, is designed to distribute the validation process more evenly across the network. He suggests, &#8220;For each slot, we choose 4,096 currently active validators, and we carefully adjust that set during each slot in such a way that we still have safety.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8220;Why Not Just Do Committees&#8221;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Vitalik Buterin highlighted the limitations of the committee-based security model used by other blockchains. This model, which selects a group of validators randomly for each slot, lacks accountability in case of a 51% attack. In such an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/thunder-terminal-claims-security-after-192000-exploit-hacker-demands-ransom-in-dispute.htm">attack</a>, the economic cost to the perpetrators is minimal since most validators involved in the attack remain unseen, not being chosen for the committee.</p>
<p>Contrastingly, Ethereum’s current system imposes severe penalties for similar attacks, slashing a large fraction of the attacking validators&#8217; deposits. While Ethereum&#8217;s high penalty approach is effective, it might be excessively punitive. So a balanced solution that still maintains a high total amount of slashable Ethereum but makes some concessions on validator accountability would be the answer.</p>

<p>Arkham Intelligence <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/former-president-donald-trumps-crypto-wallet-being-monitored-by-arkham-intelligence-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">tracked and identified</a> the <a href="https://twitter.com/arkhamintel/status/1691875444809781337?s=46&amp;t=RmJrzTiRa1U2w7w0BraS4g">wallet</a> in August and claimed that it was owned by the former U.S. President. Prior to Arkham Intelligence’s speculation, Trump confirmed that he owned a crypto wallet that held up to $5 million worth of Ethereum earned from NFT licensing fees.</p>
<p>According to a filing with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in January, Trump could have made up to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-filing-reveals-trump-earned-up-1-million-from-nft-sales-heres-what-you-need-know.htm">$1 million</a> from CIC Digital, the company behind the sale of his NFTs.</p>
<h2>Trump and Biden Criticized for Not Understanding Crypto</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Initially <a href="https://cryptonews.com/videos/donald-trump-99-nfts-sbf-arrest-crypto-week-in-review.htm">released</a> in December 2022, Trump’s trading cards marked his involvement in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. In the meantime, Trump and President Joe Biden were <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/democratic-presidential-candidate-dean-phillips-says-biden-and-trump-dont-understand-crypto.htm">criticized</a> for not understanding crypto by Representative Dean Phillips.</p>
<p>During the Crypto Presidential Forum, Democratic nominee Phillips acknowledged his own gaps in knowledge about financial technology and digital assets, but pointed out the scarcity of expertise in Congress regarding these topics, specifically targeting Trump and Biden.</p>
<p>“The two leading candidates right now, on both the left and the right, for the U.S. presidency are absolutely not in positions to understand it, prepare us for it, anticipate it, and lead us into the next century,” said Phillips. “Joe Biden and Donald Trump, at their age and stage of life, are simply not the right people to lead us forward.”</p>
<h2>The &#8220;MugShot&#8221; Edition Trading Cards</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Earlier this month, Trump introduced his latest <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trump-released-latest-mugshot-nfts-commemorating-his-previous-arrest.htm">“MugShot” edition</a> NFT collection, referring to his previous arrest. Buyers who purchase 47 or more of these $99 priced digital trading cards will be granted a dinner with Trump and a piece of the suit he wore during his arrest.</p>

<p>Ethereum is one of the most widely used blockchain networks globally. Recent <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/64d01c8d3e922f69b35d7f0a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">findings</a> from CoinMarketCap show that Ethereum has the highest number of total developers, accounting for 16% of all developers in the crypto sector.</p>
<figure id="attachment_142932" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142932" style="width: 1274px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-142932 size-full" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm.png" alt="" width="1274" height="716" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm.png 1274w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm-1024x575.png 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702771450-screenshot-2023-12-16-at-1-55-36pm-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1274px) 100vw, 1274px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-142932" class="wp-caption-text">Source: CoinMarketCap</figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, the Ethereum network has also become extremely prone to security exploits. Blockchain security firm Beosin <a href="https://medium.com/@Beosin_com/q3-2023-global-web3-security-report-aml-analysis-crypto-regulatory-landscape-9f4c646ca71" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> in its “Global Web3 Security Report &#8221; that crypto investors lost $282.96 million to rug pulls during quarter three of this year. The report further noted that phishing schemes generated $66.15 million during the same time period. According to findings from Beosin, the Ethereum blockchain underwent the most losses and incidents overall.</p>

<h2><b>Updated framework for reviewing smart contract code</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Chaals Nevile, technical program director at the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) — an organization that aims to drive the use of enterprise ethereum as an open standard — told Cryptonews that there are known problems within Ethereum that are impacting the ecosystem’s security. “The most obvious problem is that the Solidity compiler – which outputs byte code and other artifacts needed for deployment of smart contracts – has bugs. As the compiler evolves, old bugs are fixed, but new ones are also created,” said Nevile.</p>
<p>In order to address this and other challenges, the EEA established the “<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-advances-with-standards-for-smart-contract-security-audits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EthTrust Security Levels Working Group in November 2020</a>.” In August 2022, the group released the publication of the “EthTrust Security Levels Specification v1.” This specification has since served as a framework for developers, organizations and customers leveraging and reviewing smart contract code written in Solidity, Ethereum’s main programming language.</p>
<p>Yet as the Ethereum network continues to advance, Nevile pointed out that the EthTrust Security Levels Specification required updates to reflect ongoing and new security developments. “For instance, the v1 specification covers bugs up to about the year 2022, yet new bugs were discovered after we released v1,” he said.</p>
<p>This in mind, Nevile shared that today the EEA announced the release of<a href="http://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Version 2.0 of its EthTrust Security Levels Specification</a>. Neville noted that the EthTrust Security Levels Specification v2 addresses issues such as newly discovered bugs in the <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solidity-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solidity compiler</a>, treatment of rounding errors, more vigorous treatment of read-only reentrancy attacks and more.</p>
<p>Updates are critical, as the Ethereum ecosystem has fallen victim to security exploits in the past due to these specific issues. For instance, Michael Lewellen, head of solutions architecture at OpenZeppelin – a security firm building an open-source framework to secure smart contracts – told Cryptonews that “<a href="https://neptunemutual.com/blog/the-story-behind-the-dao-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The DAO</a>” hack occurred due to reentrancy. “The DAO Hack was the original big hack on Ethereum that happened in 2016 and got everyone thinking more about security. This was a classic case of reentrancy,” Lewellen said. The DAO hack resulted in a loss of $3.64 million in ETH.</p>
<p>Nevile explained that <a href="https://medium.com/@zokyo.io/read-only-reentrancy-attacks-understanding-the-threat-to-your-smart-contracts-99444c0a7334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reentrancy</a> occurs when a developer starts a smart contract and then requests for the program to do something different while it is in the middle of running code. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Essentially this means that a program is halfway through running code, but then something else is asked of it. As a result, the two requests could get mixed up. A program hacker can then use this mix up as an opportunity to steal people&#8217;s money or change the prompt of things.”</p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Will an industry standard be widely adopted? </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Aware of the severity behind such incidents, Lewellen pointed out that OpenZeppelin leverages the EthTrust Security Levels v1 framework to prevent such security vulnerabilities from occurring. “We use this framework as a pre-audit assessment for many of our clients. This allows clients to know that we are checking for certain instances during the audit process.”</p>
<p>This industry standard seems to be helpful, as an anonymous OpenZeppelin client revealed to Cryptonews that EthTrust is what the company had been lacking in the past. The source said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We failed our previous security audit because we didn&#8217;t have clear guidance on what security requirements we were missing. We feel much more confident going into our next audit after reviewing the EthTrust requirements and implementing them in our codebase.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet Nevile commented that while feedback for the EthTrust standard v1 has been positive, it remains challenging getting developers and organizations to know that such an open standard exists. He also noted that the framework is best suited for newer Ethereum projects. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Projects like Uniswap, Aave and others may look at these specifications and find them to be useful, but for the most part it&#8217;s common knowledge for them. Projects that are just now being developed and going to production on Ethereum will likely find these specifications to be valuable.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the question remains whether or not such an industry standard will help prevent security exploits on Ethereum moving forward. John Wingate, founder and chief executive officer of BankSocial – a financial services company that leverages blockchain technology – told Cryptonews that the changing nature of industry standards is problematic. “Standards are always changing; languages are always depreciating methods, variables, data types, and object types,” he said.</p>
<p>This concern in mind, Nevile shared that version 3 of the EthTrust specification is already in the works. “We are roughly 16 months between publications. I think that 12 to 18 months is a frequent enough revision to ensure that we don’t fall out of date.”</p>
<p>Although this may be, Wingate believes that repeatable, automated testing is the only way to make sure decentralized applications are adhering to best practices that may prevent security exploits. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This means being able to set your platform up to have regular, automated, code testing. When the source code, or compiler is known to have a bug, the automation tool can be updated and then everyone gets the benefit of scanning for the exploits.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Taipei Blockchain Week kicked off this week with around 2,000 people from the crypto community gathering on Thursday to hear industry players discuss blockchain trends ranging from Llayer 1&#8217;s role in Web3&#8217;s in 2024 to the future of decentralized finance (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-news/">DeFi</a>).</p>
<p>The event opened with a keynote speech from the Mayor of Taipei, Chiang Wan-an who welcomed innovation to the city. High-profile guest speakers included Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, and Binance’s new CEO Richard Teng who spoke about the importance of regulation in the crypto space.</p>
<p>From a live stream Teng, a former Abu Dhabi regulator who was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/doj-holds-press-conference-on-binance-cz-announces-new-ceo.htm">recently appointed CEO of Binance</a> succeeding Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ),  said he felt “humbled and honoured” to be leading the exchange adding he has seen the user base continue to grow – currently standing at 167 million users.</p>
<p>Speaking about his past role as a regulator he stressed that it is important to support growth as well as manage risk – just focusing on managing risk means the growth dynamic will be overlooked.</p>
<p>“Traditional media still associate crypto and blockchain with scams and illicit funds – but if you look at data issued by the US financial crime office Chainalysis and many other research pieces &#8212; the amount of illicit funds going into crypto is 0.02%,” said Teng.</p>
<p>Teng went on to add he remains bullish regarding crypto and with the Bitcoin Halving coming up and “hopefully” with an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-market-could-grow-by-1-trillion-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-cryptoquant-report.htm">ETF being approved in the US</a> more institutions will be entering the space.</p>
<h3><b>Special Guest Buterin Holds Taiwan Employment Gold Card</b></h3>
<p>Buterin spoke at the conference enthusiastically talking through Ethereuam’s pipeline. Ethereum co-founder Buterin has a special relationship with Taiwan having been granted a <a href="https://www.ftvnews.com.tw/news/detail/2023816F10M1">Taiwan Employment Gold Card</a> &#8211; a permit that will allow him to legally reside and work in the country.</p>
<p>Most recently <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-plans-to-redesign-ethereum-staking-praises-utxo.htm">Buterin</a>, who introduced a conceptual architecture called the enshrined Zero-Knowledge <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-delays-decision-on-invesco-galaxys-ethereum-etf-until-february-2024.htm">Ethereum</a> Virtual Machine (ZK-EVM) to enhance the main chain’s efficiency has <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/enshrined_zk_evm">blogged</a>, that the proposal of the enshrined <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nil-foundation-launches-type-1-zkevm-for-scalability-on-ethereum.htm">ZK-EVM</a> is aimed at integrating advanced cryptographic techniques directly into Ethereum’s main chain. By doing so, it seeks to provide a more secure and efficient verification process for Ethereum transactions. Specifically, it intends to improve and optimize the operation of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-layer-2-blast-closes-in-on-solana-after-reaching-600-million-tvl-in-10-days.htm">Layer-2</a> applications.</p>
<h3><b>What Bear Market?</b></h3>
<p>With stands full of cakes and freebies, and human sized neon yellow Pikachu’s roaming around the conference centre in Taiwan – it certainly didn’t feel like a bear market. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-fomc-optimism-spot-etf-buzz-lift-btc-to-42750.htm">price of Bitcoin has soared</a> to $42,777, marking a significant 4% increase on Thursday. This rally is buoyed by a wave of optimism following the Federal Reserve’s latest FOMC meeting, which indicated a dovish stance on future rate hikes, and sparked lively discussions on the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, with investment giant BlackRock interpreting the minutes as a ‘green light for investors.’</p>
<p>David Tng, managing director of TZ APAC, which is Asia&#8217;s leading Tezos blockchain Incubator told Cryptonews there is an excellent turnout ths year. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve been very impressed at how Taipei Blockchain Week has grown. The event has gathered leaders and innovators from all walks of the industry, from Layer 1 blockchain entities to startups making a real-world impact”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tng who is based in Singapore and flew to Taipie for the event – and sees Taipei Blockchain Week as an excellent opportunity to network explaining that the Taiwanese artists and projects he has met are great symbols of the innovation he is seeing in the region.</p>
<p>“The akaSwap team was one of the startups that really caught my eye with their unique gamification approach they take when building their products,&#8221; said Tng.</p>
<p>Day 2 of the event continues tomorrow.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-plans-to-redesign-ethereum-staking-praises-utxo.htm">Vitalik Buterin</a>, Ethereum&#8217;s co-founder, has introduced a conceptual architecture called the enshrined Zero-Knowledge <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-delays-decision-on-invesco-galaxys-ethereum-etf-until-february-2024.htm">Ethereum</a> Virtual Machine (ZK-EVM) to enhance the main chain&#8217;s efficiency.</p>
<p>According to Buterin&#8217;s <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/enshrined_zk_evm">latest blog</a>, this proposal of the enshrined <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nil-foundation-launches-type-1-zkevm-for-scalability-on-ethereum.htm">ZK-EVM</a> is aimed at integrating advanced cryptographic techniques directly into Ethereum’s main chain. By doing so, it seeks to provide a more secure and efficient verification process for Ethereum transactions. Specifically, it intends to improve and optimize the operation of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-ethereum-layer-2-blast-closes-in-on-solana-after-reaching-600-million-tvl-in-10-days.htm">Layer-2</a> applications.</p>

<h2>Enshrined ZK-EVM on Layer-1</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The key idea of an enshrined ZK-EVM is to provide a native, in-protocol system for verifying Ethereum blocks using Zero-Knowledge Proofs. This system aims to reduce dependency on external codebases and minimize risks associated with bugs in these external systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;This situation is suboptimal, because these projects are replicating a functionality that already exists in the Ethereum protocol,&#8221; explained Buterin. The enshrined ZK-EVM would essentially perform similar functions as the current Layer-1 Ethereum blocks but with enhanced security and efficiency. &#8220;The most important property, in addition to basic guarantees of correct functionality and security, is speed.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_142081" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142081" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-142081" src="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702546071-zk-evm.jpg" alt="ZK-EVM" width="1200" height="602" srcset="https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702546071-zk-evm.jpg 1200w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702546071-zk-evm-300x151.jpg 300w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702546071-zk-evm-1024x514.jpg 1024w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702546071-zk-evm-768x385.jpg 768w, https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702546071-zk-evm-150x75.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-142081" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Vitalik Buterin</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the significant aspects of this proposal is the compatibility with Ethereum&#8217;s multi-client philosophy. Buterin emphasized the importance of supporting different clients with varying proving systems.</p>
<p>“Compatibility with Ethereum’s multi-client philosophy&#8230;means that we want to avoid enshrining a single proving system, and instead allow different clients to use different proving systems,” said Buterin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Buterin discusses the importance of ensuring data availability and auditability within this system. He argued that any execution proven by the ZK-EVM must guarantee that the underlying data is accessible for inspection in case of issues. This transparency is crucial for maintaining trust and reliability in the network.</p>
<h2>Key Terms and Concepts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
To better understand the context of enshrined Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, it&#8217;s essential to clarify some key terms and concepts:</p>
<p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs): These are cryptographic methods that allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. In the context of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/china-plans-to-verify-identities-of-its-1-4-billion-residents-through-blockchain-based-platform.htm">blockchain</a>, ZK-Proofs enable the verification of transactions while preserving privacy and reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored.</p>
<p>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): The EVM operates as a decentralized global-scale computer, within which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts exist and interact. Every transaction or smart contract executed on Ethereum is processed through the EVM, functioning as the central executor of all network activities.</p>
<p>Layer 2 Solutions: These are technologies built on top of a blockchain (known as Layer 1) to improve its scalability and efficiency. Layer 2 solutions, like rollups or state channels, handle transactions off the main chain but still derive security from the underlying Layer 1 blockchain.</p>

<h2>Trend of Ethereum ETF Applications</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In September, Invesco and Galaxy Digital filed the form for the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/invesco-galaxy-pursue-spot-ether-etf-application.htm">application</a> of the spot Ethereum ETF. According to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1995569/000119312523246762/d470525ds1.htm">S-1 registration statement</a>, their ETF aims to “reflect the performance of the spot price of ether” by holding units of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-december-13-fetch-ai-neo-cosmos.htm">crypto</a> with a separate custodian.</p>
<p>As of today, major financial institutions including BlackRock, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ark-invest-dumps-nearly-13-million-in-gbtc-shares-amid-broader-market-sell-off.htm">ARK</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-calls-for-comments-on-fidelitys-spot-ether-etf-application.htm">Fidelity</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etf-in-q1-and-bitcoin-price-all-time-high-in-q4-vaneck-predictions-2024.htm">VanEck</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-seeks-public-feedback-for-franklin-templeton-and-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">Hashdex</a> have filed spot Ethereum ETF applications with the SEC, all pending final decisions.</p>
<h2>SEC Holds Meetings with Major Bitcoin ETF Issuers</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/four-major-bitcoin-etf-issuers-have-met-with-sec-in-last-few-days-bloomberg-analyst.htm">Recent filings</a> indicated that the SEC has been meeting with major <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-btc-falls-7-in-7-days-time-to-buy-the-dip.htm">Bitcoin</a> ETF issuers and including BlackRock, Grayscale, Franklin, and Fidelity. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-holds-meetings-with-grayscale-blackrock-on-bitcoin-etfs.htm">meetings</a> have brought renewed momentum to the discussion of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals.</p>
<p>With the SEC set to make a decision on BlackRock’s application by mid-January, these discussions are critical. The repeated engagements and strategic amendments to applications, such as BlackRock&#8217;s inclusion of cash purchases for new fund shares, reflect a concerted effort to align with regulatory expectations.</p>
<p>Seyffart suggests that the SEC might consider simultaneous approvals for multiple applications to ensure a level playing field among competitors. As the SEC&#8217;s review process continues, the crypto community awaits what could be a landmark decision in the history of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The burn rate has outpaced new Ether issuance by approximately 30%, with the network issuing around 885,000 ETH as staking rewards during the same period.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ETH&#8217;s current supply stands 56,000 ETH lower than its recent peak of around 120.27 million on October 31. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The decrease represents an 18% reduction in Ethereum&#8217;s supply since the Shanghai upgrade over the past six weeks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The recent surge in burned ETH can be attributed to increased on-chain trading, primarily driven by the growing adoption of trading bots.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Uniswap transactions have been the largest contributor to burned ETH in the last 30 days, accounting for approximately 10% of the total ETH destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notably, prominent public trading bots such as Maestro and Banana Gun have ranked among the top burning entities on the network, collectively burning around 9% of the ETH removed from circulation in the past month.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The upgrade resulted in a significant reduction of new Ether issuance, making the network deflationary through the burning of base transaction fees.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Following the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum demonstrated the potential for deflationary behavior, with the supply peaking at nearly 120.534 million ETH three weeks later. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The burn rate accelerated in early 2023, leading to a decrease of approximately 276,500 ETH between February 1 and June 8.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although the burn rate slowed down in the third quarter, the supply of ETH continued to decrease until reaching a post-merge low of around 120.2 million ETH on August 31, effectively offsetting inflation by 307,370 ETH.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notably, throughout September and October, the supply of Ether turned inflationary for the first time in 2023, with approximately 53,700 coins added to ETH&#8217;s supply. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nevertheless, Ethereum&#8217;s on-chain activity experienced a resurgence in November, driven by bullish market conditions, resulting in a significant acceleration in the burn rate.</span></p>

<p>A pillar of Ethereum&#8217;s original vision was decentralization—the idea that its blockchain would operate outside constraints from centralized entities like governments and corporations. Recent data indicates this ideology is being tested, however, as key Ethereum players increasingly censor transactions linked to US sanctions.</p>
<h2>The Turn Toward Censorship</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A major turning point came last year when the US Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/federal-court-supports-sanctions-tornado-cash-crypto-mixer-despite-user-protest.htm">(OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash</a>, an Ethereum mixing service that enabled private transactions. OFAC claimed the tool was utilized by terrorists and other illicit actors.</p>
<p>In response, Tornado Cash&#8217;s code was added to the same <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">US blacklist containing bad actors like North Korea and Hamas</a>. Supporters <a href="https://forum.dfinity.org/t/tornado-cash-is-banned-how-will-it-affect-spinner-cash/14768">decried the targeting</a> of Tornado Cash as government overreach and censorship. Ethereum has not proven immune, however.</p>

<p>In recent months, censorship of transactions tied to US sanctions has markedly increased on Ethereum, according to <a href="https://censorship.pics/">new research<u></u> from Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter</a>. A metric measuring “censored” blocks on Ethereum surged from around 25% in November 2022 to approximately 72% currently.</p>
<p>This spike stems largely from block builders, who assemble transactions into blocks and <a href="https://mevboost.pics/">provide them to validators</a> to add to Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain. Five major block builders now contribute over 90% of Ethereum blocks. Of those, only one major builder, <a href="https://www.titanbuilder.xyz/">Titan Builder</a>, claims it does not filter transactions in this manner.</p>
<p>The lone block builder still processing all transactions claims over 20% of blocks. If Titan began engaging in censorship as well, per Wahrstätter&#8217;s analysis, overall Ethereum censorship could immediately jump to over 90%. Such reliance on a few builders contradicts the decentralized ethos blockchain promised.</p>

<h2>Impacts on Ethereum&#8217;s Core Values</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
For many in the Ethereum community, such censorship represents a betrayal of the network&#8217;s founding principles. The technology&#8217;s decentralized appeal rests on it being uncontrolled and unfettered by real-world biases. Yet block builders now hold immense power over which transactions end up on Ethereum, granting them the power to selectively exclude addresses flagged by OFAC.</p>
<p>Some builders defend this censorship as merely <a href="https://twitter.com/Zach_Glass/status/1557397894210232322">prudent compliance with US regulations</a>. However, critics argue it sets a dangerous precedent of centralized entities overriding Ethereum&#8217;s core coding to meet external rules. It also limits full access to the blockchain for individuals sanctioned by the US government.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">F2Pool was filtering (censoring) OFAC Bitcoin transactions recently and everyone got mad and then they stopped almost immediately. </p>
<p>Can Ethereum do the same with censoring builders? As in, just ask that they stop. Like is this a corollary would you say or no? <a href="https://t.co/6NUBmoEWuF">pic.twitter.com/6NUBmoEWuF</a></p>

<h2></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h2>Centralization Creeping In</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Beyond censorship, the centralization of key transaction functions into a few dominant <a href="https://protos.com/ethereum-centralization-is-becoming-a-serious-problem/">block builders could pose security risks</a>, according to experts. Further, these players gain privileged access to pending transaction data, potentially allowing them to maximize profits through trading strategies before transactions are added to the blockchain. This raises additional questions about fairness and transparency.</p>
<p>Ethereum was designed as a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/decentralized-social-network-friendtech-surpasses-1-million-in-24-hour-fees-leaving-uniswap-and-bitcoin-behind.htm">decentralized network</a> not beholden to external constraints. Block builders processing transactions increasingly censor addresses tied to US sanctions, however, calling Ethereum&#8217;s decentralization into question. While some view this censorship as prudent legal compliance, critics see it as contradicting Ethereum&#8217;s core values.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, Ethereum&#8217;s leadership is exploring ways to curb censorship trends. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/09/vitalik-buterins-new-ethereum-roadmap-takes-aim-at-mev-and-censorship/">Vitalik Buterin has proposed updates</a> that inhibit transaction blocking by validators and builders.</p>
<p>This challenge to Ethereum&#8217;s decentralized ethos may prove to be a defining one, forcing the community to confront difficult questions about the limits and future direction of the technology. The answers could shape Ethereum&#8217;s ability to evolve while retaining the core principles on which it was founded.</p>

<p>The U.S. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-pushes-for-judge-to-classify-crypto-as-securities-in-terraform-labs-case-bypassing-jury.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) has postponed its decision on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-positions-itself-for-bitcoin-etf-race-with-hire-of-former-invesco-head-john-hoffman.htm">Grayscale</a>&#8216;s application for its spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-ethereum-etf-plans-spur-on-bitcoin-etf-token-investors-to-take-last-chance-to-buy-at-low-0-005-price.htm">Ethereum exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF), extending the review period with a new deadline set for January 2024.</p>
<p>According to the SEC’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2023/34-99082.pdf">latest filing</a>, the commission has now designated Jan. 25, 2024, as the new deadline to replace the previous due date of Dec. 11, 2023. The filing stated that this postponement is to allow a longer period for comprehensive consideration of the proposed rule change and the issues it entails.</p>
<h2>SEC Postpones Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum ETF Decision</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In their explanation, the SEC wrote, &#8220;The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.&#8221;</p>
<p>By Jan. 25, the SEC “the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove” Grayscale’s proposed spot Ethereum ETF application.</p>
<p>The ongoing scrutiny by the SEC over <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-december-5-stacks-conflux-kucoin.htm">crypto</a>-based ETFs, including both Ethereum and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/btc-price-to-hit-50k-soon-as-traders-rush-to-buy-up-bitcoin-etf-btcetf-token-after-successful-2-5-million-raise.htm">Bitcoin</a>, underscores the cautious stance of the regulatory body towards integrating these digital assets into mainstream financial products. This extended deadline for Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum ETF is a continuation of the SEC&#8217;s pattern of diligently assessing the viability and impact of such investment choices in the U.S. market.</p>
<h2>Meetings and More Delayed Decisions</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The SEC has been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-holds-meetings-with-grayscale-blackrock-on-bitcoin-etfs.htm">holding meetings</a> with major financial institutions that have filed for their crypto ETFs, including Grayscale and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-and-bitwise-update-bitcoin-etf-filings-with-sec.htm">BlackRock</a>. A memorandum published by the SEC indicated that officials from the agency’s Division of Trading and Markets met with Grayscale Investments on Nov. 29 to consider the proposed conversion of Grayscale’s listed Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>Previously, the SEC has delayed its decisions on numerous ETF filings, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/global-xs-bitcoin-etf-decision-delayed-by-sec-new-deadline-set-heres-what-you-need-to-know.htm">Global X</a>’s, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-seeks-public-feedback-for-franklin-templeton-and-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etfs.htm">Franklin Templeton</a>’s, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-postpones-decision-on-hashdex-spot-bitcoin-etf-and-grayscale-ether-etf.htm">Hashdex</a>’s.</p>

<p>The Commission has not yet approved any spot Bitcoin or Ethereum ETF applications for listing on a U.S. exchange. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, the postponement is “completely normal.” Seyffart believed that once the authority decides to finally approve a crypto ETF, multiple applications can be approved simultaneously.</p>
